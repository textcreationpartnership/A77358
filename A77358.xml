            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Not ſo (ſaies the Apoſtle) for ſo, <hi>we our ſelves
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:162406:14"/>ſhould be found ſinner, and Chriſt would be made the miniſter of ſin, which God forbid:</hi> (verſe 17.) <hi>yea, and I ſhould build again the things which I have deſtroyed, and make my ſelf a tranſgreſſor:</hi> (verſe 18.) <hi>But I through the law, am dead unto the law, that I might live unto God.</hi> (verſe the 19.)</p>

               <p>And this ye have moſt expreſly, in that 6. Chap. of <hi>John,</hi> at the 40. verſ. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, That every one which ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> But though he ſhall have everlaſting life hereafter, it may be he hath not this life for the preſent: Look therfore what he ſaies at the 47. verſ. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, He that beleeveth on me hath everlaſting life.</hi> 'Tis not ſaid, He <hi>ſhall</hi> have everlaſting life, but he <hi>hath</hi> everlaſting life; everlaſting life is begun in him already. And that ye may be the more ſure of it, he gives you a double Verily; <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto ye, He that believeth on me, hath everlaſting life.</hi> But how can this be? Nay, how ſhould it be otherwiſe? for a mans life is, as his meat is: and ſaies our Saviour, <hi>I am the bread of life,</hi> at the 48. verſ. Then at the 54. verſ. <hi>Wheſoever eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life: For my fleſh</hi> (<hi>at the</hi> 55. verſ.) <hi>is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed; he that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me and I in him: As the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father; ſo he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me.</hi> So that ye ſee, this Chapter is ful of it, here is a cloud of wineſſes: I ſay ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That every godly, gracious man, is a living man, and lives another life from the life of the world, a ſpiritual life, and is in the ſtate of ſpiritual life.</p>
               <p>For the opening of this Truth unto ye, We muſt firſt of all enquire, What this Spiritual life is. Take therefore this deſcription of it: <hi>It is that ſupernatural perfection of ſoul, whereby a man being united unto Chriſt, by the Spirit, is able to act, move, and work towards God as his utmoſt end.</hi>

And upon this account, when as the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal bethought himſelf, then he is ſaid to return unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

But now, every godly, gracious man does thus reflect upon his own action, and is able to do it. So then, take the Argument in the whole, and it lies thus: If a godly, gracious man, have all the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Properties of thoſe Three lives, in a ſpiritual way and manner; then certainly he is in the ſtate of life, and does live a ſpiritual life.

Though a wicked man may act, and move, and work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; yet notwithſtanding, that motion does but ariſe from the natural perfection that is left in him by the fall. Take a Civil man, and though he have many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vertues, what is there in him that lies beyond the reach of Nature, with the dye of Goſpel-Education. Put now, this Spiritual life, it is a Supernatural perfection. Indeed it is ſaid of Hypocrites, They have a Name to live: I but, they are dead; they are accounted living, but they live not: why? becauſe they are not united unto Chriſt by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is the other property of the Spiritual life. This Spiritual life (I ſay) It is the Supernatural perfection of the Soul, whereby a man is able to act, and move, and work towards God as his utmoſt end. Now there is no wicked man, that is able to move towards God as his utmoſt end: for, (as the Schools well ſpeak) wicked men, they do Uſe what they ſhould Enjoy, that is God: and they do Enjoy what they ſhould Uſe; that is, the World. What wicked man is there in all the world; that is able to move, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:162406:18"/>work towards God as his laſt and his utmoſt end? There is a Twofold End: There is an <hi>Hither</hi>-End, or a <hi>Proxie:</hi> and a <hi>Remote</hi>-End: A Hithermoſt-End, and a Remote, or ones Utmoſt End.

It is a life, better and beyond the life that thou ſhouldeſt have lived in the ſtate of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: for as the ſecond Adam is more excellent than the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45.</note> 
                  <hi>The firſt man</hi> Adam <hi>was made a living ſoul; but the ſecond Adam was made a quickning Spirit.</hi> So that life that comes from Chriſt the ſecond Adam, is better and beyond that life that you ſhould have had from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency.</p>
               <p>Of all lives, this Spiritual life (that now I am ſpeaking of) is the moſt <hi>Pleaſant life.</hi> In the 36. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ſaies the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt concerning the godly, (at the 8. verſe) <hi>They ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe: and thou ſhalt make them drink of the river of thy pleaſures.</hi> Now, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth well obſerve upon that place, The River hath many waves, one following upon another: &amp; ſo are the pleaſures of the Saints, the Spiritual pleaſures; one wave, one plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure following upon another; and it is a deep river. Oh! but a River may be dry. Nay, it cannot be dry if it be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with a Fountain, and with Springs. Now ſee what follows, (at the 9. verſe) <hi>They ſhall ſatisfie themſelves of the river of thy pleaſures:</hi> Why? <hi>for with thee is the Fountain of life.</hi> So that, if a man do but enjoy God in Chriſt, and be united unto Chriſt by the Spirit, he hath this life, which ſhall be as a river of pleaſures maintained with a Fountain. Yea, this life it ſhall know no end. Your lives now, they run into death: but this life, this Spiritual life, it ſhall know no end. The Apoſtle argues unto the Romans, that they ſhould die no more, becauſe they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with Chriſt in his death:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.10</note> And therefore (ſaies he) <hi>In that he died once, he ſhall die no more.</hi> And ſo, you having communion with Chriſt in his death, you ſhall die no more: once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live ſpiritually, and ye ſhall die no more. Who can go to Heaven and pull Chriſt out of Heaven? In the 2. Chapter
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:162406:20"/>of <hi>Paul</hi> unto the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> the 5. ver. ſaies the Apoſtle there, <hi>Even when we were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, hath he quickned us together with Chriſt: and he hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Here's ſitting together in heavenly places with Jeſus Chriſt; and we are raiſed up in Chriſt. So then, if once ye have this Spiritual life in Chriſt, ye ſhall never die again Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
               <p>And this life (that now I am ſpeaking of) 'tis of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lives, the moſt <hi>Communicative</hi> life. A Man does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate life unto his Child; but his Child is not able preſently, aſſoon as 'tis born, to communicate life unto an other child. One Beaſt does communicate life unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Sheep communicates life unto the Lamb: but the Lamb aſſoon as 'tis brought forth is not able to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate life to another, and beget another. And ſo, the Herb communicates life to another, but not preſently aſſoon as 'tis an Herb. But now, no ſooner does a man partake of this Spiritual life, but he is preſently able to communicate life unto another: <hi>When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>

               <p>And let me tell you one thing more: Though your ſins have been very great while you were in the ſtate of death, before you were made partakers of this Spiritual life: yet when once ye come to partake of this ſpiritual life, the Lord wil look upon al your former ſins under another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, a <hi>mollifying</hi> conſideration.<note place="margin">

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah:</hi> a mollifying term: Why? becauſe that <hi>David</hi> had repented of the Sin, &amp; now the Lord does not look upon it, but under this mollifying term; Save only, in the <hi>matter;</hi> not in the <hi>murder</hi> of <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi> And ſo, if thou do repent, and turn unto the Lord thy God, though thy ſins have bin very great in the ſtate of thy death, yet if once come to be made partaker of this Spiritual life, the Lord will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all thy former ſins under other terms, and mollifying conſiderations: He will not ſay, Here's this poor wretch, that now I do look upon as a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> or a <hi>Swearer;</hi> but he will ſay thus; This my ſon was dead, but is now alive: this my daughter was dead, and is now alive. Thus the Lord will look upon your former evils, if once ye come to be made partaker of this Spiritual life. Oh! therefore, what a bleſſed condition are the Saints and people of God in, that are made partakers of this ſame Spiritual life. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it is written of a certain <hi>Martyr</hi> in the Primitive times, a woman; when ſhe was brought before the enemies of the Goſpel, they put divers queſtions to her, and ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered all their queſtions with one anſwer, which was this: <hi>Chriſtiana ſum,</hi> I AM A CHRISTIAN. When they ſaid unto her, Woman, Art thou married or no. <hi>I am a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> ſaies ſhe. What Parents haſt thou, Woman? <hi>I am a Chriſtian,</hi> ſaies ſhe. Woman, Where doeſt thou live? <hi>I am a Chriſtian,</hi> ſaies ſhe. She anſwered all their queſtions with this, <hi>I am a Chriſtian.</hi> And ſo, me thinks a man may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all objections that are made unto him with this: <hi>I am alive in Chriſt.</hi> But, thou haſt a dead Eſtate, much of it is loſt at Sea, or at Land. Well, but <hi>I am alive in Chriſt.</hi> But, haſt thou not a dead Husband, or a dead Wife, or a dead Child? <hi>I am alive in Chriſt.</hi> But, is not thy Name dead and buried under reproaches? <hi>I am alive in Chriſt.</hi> A poor ſoul may anſwer all with this; <hi>I am alive in Chriſt.</hi> Oh! what a bleſſed thing is it, for a man to be made partaker of this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:162406:21"/>Spiritual life! This is the condition of all the Saints. Art thou therefore alive, and made partaker of this Spiritual-life? bleſſed art thou from the Lord, and thou ſhalt be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to all eternity.</p>

                  <hi>I am affraid that I have not this Spiritual life; for my heart is Dead, and Cold, and Stiffe: and dead men, they are Cold and Stiffe, very Stiffe: and truly ſo 'tis with me; My heart is Cold, and Dead, and Stiffe, and therfore I fear I am free among the Dead, and not free among the Living.</hi>

                  </label> Have ye not heard, That there is a deadneſs which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to <hi>Livelineſs,</hi> aſwel as a death that is oppoſit to <hi>Life?</hi> And were thine heart dead, with a death oppoſite to <hi>Life,</hi> thou couldſt not feel it. And I appeal to thee; If that thy ſoul be alive in oppoſition to <hi>death;</hi> haſt thou not more cauſe to be thankful, that thy ſoul is alive in oppofition to <hi>death,</hi> than to be diſcouraged, that thy ſoul is dead in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to <hi>Livelineſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is a differance (ye know) between the coldneſs of a <hi>Living</hi> man, and the coldneſs of a <hi>Dead</hi> man. Take a <hi>dead</hi> man, and if he be cold, 'tis not al your fires wil put warmth into him, or your <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> or your chafing and rubbing of him, or your warm beds that will make him warm. But now, take a man that is cold, and <hi>Living;</hi> and if ye chafe him, or bring him to the fire, or lay him in a good warm bed; he recovers his warmth again. And ſo 'tis with a godly heart, though cold, yet bring it unto the Ordinance, either Publickly, or Privatly, and it recovers its warmth againe: and hath it not been even ſo with ſome of you?</p>
               <p>It's true, A Dead man is <hi>Stiffe.</hi> But have you found your ſelves in a way of ſin, an evil way; and are ye ſo ſtiffe therein, as ye will not be put out of your way, no not by admonition? then ye are ſtiffe indeed. There are two men that are out of their way, (ſuppoſe) The <hi>Traveller,</hi> and the <hi>Thief:</hi> The <hi>Traveller</hi> is out of his way: and if you come to him and ſay, Sir, you are much out of your way: He hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens to ye, and he thanks ye, and he returns into his way
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:162406:22"/>again. But if ye come to a <hi>Thief</hi> and ſay, Sir, you are out of your way, He laughs, and ſcorns, and comes not into the way. So, there are ſome indeed, that are out of their way; and if you do come to them and tell them, that they are out of their way; they will bleſſe, and praiſe the Lord for your admonition, and labor to return into their way again. But ſome there are, that if ye tell them, that they are out of their way, they will rather ſcorn and jeer at it; What have you to do to meddle with me? what have you to do to meddle with my waies? meddle with your own matters. Theſe men are ſtiffe, they are ſtiffe indeed; why? becauſe they are dead; they are ſtiffe in the way of their ſin, and they wil not be ſtird out, no, not by Admonition, why? becauſe they are dead. But I appeal to ye, whether is it thus with ye or no? Don't ye ſay rather, I praiſe the Lord, though ſometimes, (yea many times) I am out of the way, and in the way of ſin; yet I can rejoyce in an Admonition, and bleſſe the Lord for an Admonition: Yea, this I can ſpeak, though my heart be ſometimes very cold, yet I have found heat, and warmth recovered again, either under a Publick, or under a Private Ordinance: Well then, be of good comfort, thou art not dead; though thou mayeſt be aſleep, yet thou mayeſt be among the living.</p>

                  <hi>I am affraid that I am not alive ſpiritually, that I am not made partaker of this ſpiritual life, becauſe I do not grow in grace; and this is the difference between a Living child and a Dead child: the Dead, painted child grows not, but the Living child grows: and the Lord knows, I do not grow in grace, and therefore I fear that I am but the painted child of God, and I am not the Living child.</hi>

                  </label> If this were true, it were ill: for growth (indeed) is a ſign of life. But whoever you are that make this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and lie under this fear: Give me leave to propound to ye Two or Three Queſtions.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt. Do ye not grow more out of Love with your own Righteouſneſs; and with your own Duties, as to the reſting on them? The ſtronger a man grows in grace, the more he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:162406:22"/>grows into Chriſt; and ſo, the more he grows off from Himſelf, and his own Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly. Do ye not find, that ye are leſſe ſubject to be offended now than heretofore ye were? When a man is in the ſtate of Nature, and in Spiritual death, then he is apt to be offended againſt all actions, againſt the good way of God, and the people of God; This is your Godlineſs, theſe are your Profeſſors, and they are all ſo: very apt to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. When a man is converted, and turn'd to God; while he is weak in grace, he is apt to ſtumble, and to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; but the ſtronger he grows in grace, the leſſe he will be offended.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly. Whether do ye not grow more off from the youthfull things that godly men do look unto? I ſay, the things that the youthfulneſs of godlineſs is taken much with? Ye know, that Youth is taken with many things that the ſtate of man is not. A child, a little child is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with Babies, and with Rattles, and with Gaies; and when it grows bigger to eight, nine, or ten years old, 'tis ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with other things; and as the child growes into a man, ſo he grows off from thoſe childiſh, and youthfull things. There are ſome things, that the youth of godlines is taken withall; as, taken much with expreſſions in Prayer, and Duty, and Hearing the Word; and taken much with the Sence &amp; feeling of Gods love; (this is good) &amp; they cannot live without it. But when a man grows into more ſtrength of grace, then he grows off from theſe things that the youth of godlineſs is taken withal, and he is more able to live without them; heretofore he could not live without ſuch an expreſſion in Duty, and he could not live by faith alone: but now, when once he grows to a man in grace, he is more grown off from that which the youth of godlines is taken withall. Now upon all theſe things, I appeal to ye, who ever ye are that makes this Objection, and ſay, Ye cannot grow in grace, and therfore affraid that ye are but the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted child of God, and not the living child of God: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do ye not find, that ye are more grown off from thoſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:162406:23"/>things that the youth of godlineſs is taken with? Whether do you not find, that ye are leſſe ſubject to be offended now, than you were heretofore? And are you not more grown off from your own Righteouſneſs? Yes, I muſt needs ſay this, through the Lords goodnes and mercy to me; though I am not grown in grace as I deſire, yet I am more grown off from my own Righteouſnes than I was heretofore: and I am not ſo ſubject to be offended at the good ways of God and the people of God, as heretofore: And (I praiſe God) I can live off from thoſe things that the youth of godlineſſe is taken withal: Wel, be of good comfort, thou art grown, and thou art not the painted child, but, for ought I know, thou mayeſt be the living child, dear and precious with the Lord thy father.</p>

                  <hi>But there is one thing yet ſticks with me, and makes me affraid that I am yet dead in my ſins &amp; treſpaſſes, and that I am not made partaker of this Spiritual life, and that is this;</hi> I am alive to the World: <hi>Can a man live unto God and to the World too? when I go into the world, and upon my worldly occaſions, then I am very lively; but when I come to Duty, then I am dead, and my heart dead, and therefore I am affraid that I am not alive to God, and made partaker of this Spiritual life.</hi>

                  </label> This (if true) is very il: for I find in that 13. of <hi>Matthew</hi> (the parable of the ſeed) that there are Three <hi>falſe</hi> grounds, unto one <hi>true</hi> ground; three unſound hearts, to one ſound that live under the Goſpel, and the preaching of the Word; And that ground that goes the furtheſt and yet falls ſhort of the truth, is the ground that received the Word; the thorny ground, &amp; the thorns choak'd it: 'Tis the worldly Profeſſor. Three to one, falſe; and the worldly Profeſſor goes the furtheſt, ſuch a one as is choak'd in Duty with the world.</p>
               <p>But yet notwithſtanding, let me tell ye this: Every man is not alive to the World, or a worldly man; that does uſe the things of the world, or that is active, and chearfull in the way of his Calling: For the things of the world, they are the materials of our grace, that our grace workes upon while we are here below.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:162406:23"/>
               <p>Yea, let me tell you further, (and I pray obſerve it wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily) Poſſibly a man may ſee a greater beauty in the things of the world, after converſion, than ever he ſaw before. As now, in the caſe of the <hi>Law:</hi> while a man is in the ſtate of nature, then he is under the <hi>Law;</hi> but when a man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and drawn to Chriſt, then he is free from the Law; and then when he is freed from the Law; he ſees a greater excellency in the Law, then ever he ſaw before converſion; for then ſaies he; Now I ſee, that the Commandements is holy, juſt, and good: indeed, as to the point of <hi>juſtification,</hi> he ſees a greater emptineſs in the Law than ever he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but as to the point of <hi>Rule of life,</hi> he ſees a greater beauty in the law than ever he did before. So <hi>Paul</hi> did, as ye reade in the 7. of the <hi>Romans.</hi> So in this caſe: though as to the point of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> a man after he is converted ſees leſſe in the creature than ever he did before; yet as to the point of <hi>Chriſts purchaſes,</hi> looking upon the creature as the purchaſe of Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt hath purchaſed theſe for me; he ſees a greater beauty in them now than ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: for (ſaies he) Chriſt hath purchaſed theſe, and all theſe are mine in Chriſt, &amp; Chriſt hath paid for me; Chriſt is mine, and I am Chriſts, and theſe are mine, and all is Chriſts: Though as to the matter of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> his ſoul cannot be ſatisfied, he ſees leſſe in the world than ever he did before; yet as to the matter of <hi>Chriſts purchaſe,</hi> a man after his converſion may ſee a greater beauty in the things of the world than ever he did before.</p>
               <p>Only here, I remember the ſtory of <hi>Anſelme,</hi> walking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the fields, he ſaw a Shepherds boy that had taken a bird; and having tied a ſtone unto the leg of the bird, the bird offered to fly, and mount up, but ſtill the ſtone at her heel pul'd the bird back again: Whereupon <hi>Anſelme</hi> fals a weeping; Thus (ſaith he with himſelf) it is with men, they ſomtimes offer to mount up to God in good purpoſes, but then they have ſome earthly buſineſs at their heel, and that makes them fall down again: they purpoſe, and purpoſe; and offer, and offer to mount up to God; but there's a ſtone
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:162406:24"/>at the heel, ſome earthly buſineſs at the heel, and ſo they fall down to the earth again. So if it be with you now, if you have a ſtone at your heel, a Calling at your heel, an Imployment at your heel, an earthly buſineſs at your heel; yet if every day you are mourning, and lamenting over it, and ſaying, Oh! what a clog have I at my heel! what a ſtone have I at my heel! Oh! Lord, when ſhall I come to Heaven, that I may be freed from this clog at my heel? I ſay, if you mourn, and lament over this clog that you have at your heel, it rather argues, that you are alive than dead; and therefore take in al the comfort that hath been ſpoken concerning this Truth; The Saints and people of God, are in a moſt comfortable ſtate upon this account.</p>

If we be alive indeed, and made partakers of this Spiritual life: <hi>Why ſhould our hearts run after the things of the world, ſo as to feed on them as our meat, to be ſatisfied with them?</hi> Every life lives upon ſome meat that maintains it, and is ſutable to it. The Herb hath one kind of life, and it hath a meat which ſutes to it. The Beaſts have another life, and they have a meat that does ſute to that life. Man hath another life different from the Beaſt, and therefore he hath a meat that does ſuit to his life. Now this Spiritual life, 'tis another kind of life than the natural life of man is, and therefore it muſt have a meat that does ſute with it, meat that the world knows not of. Saies our Savior,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John.</hi> 4.32.</note> 
                  <hi>I have meat to eat that you know not of.</hi> This life of grace, it is a hidden life; and therefore the meat thereof that it lives upon, 'tis an hidden meat. Then if you are alive indeed, and have this Spiritual life; why do you live upon theſe outward things? and why ſhould our hearts run out after theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, ſo as to live upon them, and make them (as it were) our meat, for the ſatisfaction of our ſouls to live upon.</p>

If we be alive indeed, and made partakers of this Spiritual life; <hi>Why is our Communion and Fellowſhip toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no more living?</hi> Why no more living Fellowſhip and Communion? why is our Conference no more warm and living? A living coal warms (ye know:) There is this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a living coal, and a dead coal: Take a Dead coal, and though it be never ſo great or ſmall, it ſullies and blacks (more or leſſe) but it warms not. But take your Living coal, which hath fire in it, and though it be never ſo great or ſmall, it does warm, in proportion, more or leſſe it warms: And if we be as Living coals, why then is our Conference and Communion together no more warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? When ye go into Wicked and Ungodly company,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:162406:25"/>there ye meet with dead coals, and there ye are ſullied, and dirtied, and black't by them. (I ſay) If ye indeed be living coals, why is your Conference no more warm and living? Oh! what ſad times are we now fallen into? Heretofore, ſome four, or ſix, or ten years ago, ye ſhould not come into a Chriſtians company, but you ſhould have ſome heart-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Conference that you ſhould bleſs God for many yeers after. As 'tis ſaid of <hi>Junius,</hi> he came into a poor country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans houſe, and he ſpake ſo feelingly of Chriſt, that he thought it was not Knowledge only, that would ſerve a mans turn, and thereupon he thought of his own conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and was turned to God. And we reade of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> in the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> when they met together, they would ſpeak much of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven!</hi> in ſo much, as their Accuſers, their Enemies, and Perſecutors, charged them, That they aimed at the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> whereas they were ſpeaking of a <hi>Heavenly Kingdom,</hi> and not of an <hi>Earthly</hi> Kingdom. But (I ſay) they were alwaies ſpeaking of the Kingdom, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And ſo heretofore, in former times, when Chriſtians did meet together, then they would ſpeak of the Kingdom, and ſomthing that would warm their hearts together, that they might be the better al the yeer after: But now, when we are met together, either our ſpeech is about Newes, or ſome Diſpute in point of Religion, or ſome other thing; yea, though it be upon the Lords-day. But if you be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving coals, Where is your living Conference? and your heart-warming-Communion? Certainly, if you be alive in Chriſt indeed, and made partaker of this Spiritual life, you will live at a higher rate than the men of the world do.</p>

                  </label> Now mark what I ſay to that, and ſo I wil end al. There are Three mentioned in the Goſpel, whom Chriſt raiſed from the dead. One a Maid, that lay in her fathers houſe, and Chriſt came in and took her by the hand, and ſaid unto her, Ariſe. Another was a Young-man, that was carried out of his fathers houſe, and was laid out upon the Hearſe; and Chriſt came, and ſaid unto him, Ariſe. And the third was <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that had been four dayes dead and ſtank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and Chriſt ſpeaks to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and he comes forth. And theſe Three (ſaies <hi>Auſtin</hi>) ſhews thoſe that Chriſt wil raiſe up from the dead again. The firſt, (the maid that lay in her fathers houſe) notes that ſort of ſinners, that commit Secret ſins, &amp; never come abroad, never come into act. The ſecond (the ſon that was carried out of his fathers houſe, and laid upon the Hearſe) notes that ſort of ſinners, that ſin openly; Swearers, and Drunkards, whoſe ſins are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. And the Third, (that of <hi>Lazarus</hi>) notes that ſort of ſinner, that hath lien ſo long in the grave that he even ſmels again. Now I pray further obſerve this, That when Chriſt came to raiſe <hi>Lazarus,</hi> then Chriſt prayed, but he did not pray when he raiſed the other two; and he groan'd over him; he did not groan over the maid, nor over the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:162406:26"/>young-man, but he groan'd over <hi>Lazarus,</hi> to ſhew the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of raiſing a poor ſinner from the dead that hath lien long in his ſin. And therefore, if there be ever a poor ſoul here that is dead in his ſins; Oh! go to Chriſt while thou art young, and fall down before him and ſay, Oh! Lord, I have a dead heart of mine own, Oh! let me have life from thee. But whether thou beeſt young or old, here is yet hope; <hi>Lazarus raiſed</hi> as well as the young-maid, &amp; young-man; <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that lay til he ſtank again in the grave; and therefore, yet there is hope though thou haſt lien long. Wherfore, in the Name of the Lord, I beſeech you all, Come unto Jeſus Chriſt this morning. If there be ever a poor dead ſoul in this Congregation, as may be ſome there is, ſome Drunkard crept in, ſome Swearer, ſome Unclean wanton: Well, if there be ever a dead ſoul in this Congregation, now go to Chriſt that thou mayeſt have life: and I ſay to thee, Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand up from the dead, and the Lord Jeſus give us life.</p>

And this is done by the Righteouſneſs, and the Blood of Chriſt only, as the <hi>Material</hi> and <hi>Meritorious</hi> cauſe; 'Tis done only by <hi>Faith</hi> as the <hi>Inſtrumental</hi> cauſe, ſo we are ſaid to be juſtified by <hi>Faith alone.</hi> Yet not ſo, as that a man is juſtified by faith which hath no works; for all juſtifying faith is full of works: but theſe works do not come into our juſtification: As now, a mans ſervants, they have him to bed; Servants have their Maſter and Miſtris to bed, tend upon them to bed; but they do not go into the bed with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:162406:28"/>them: They are with them again in the morning, they bring them water and neceſſary things, but they do not come to bed to them. Now (ſaies <hi>Luther</hi>) Juſtification is that bed, where Chriſt and a Beleeving ſoul lies: &amp; though good works, Duties, and Prayers tend upon Chriſt, and where ever there is faith, there are theſe; yet this bed of Juſtification is kept free, and entire, and only for the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; and they come not to bed, they come not into this work. Or if you will thus: Ye know, that when an Iſraelite was ſtung in the wilderneſs, by a <hi>fiery biting ſerpent,</hi> he was then to look upon the <hi>Braſen ſerpent;</hi> and by the beholding of the Braſen-ſerpent he was cured; the looking of his eyes cured him. He had other members, there was the Arms, and the Legs, and other members that did accompany the Eyes; but though there were other members that did accompany the Eyes, it was the ſeeing of the Eyes that did cure the perſon. And ſo, though works do accompany faith; and there is no ſaving, juſtifying faith, but works accompany it; yet it is only the beholding of this Braſen-ſerpent by the eye of faith, that does cure the ſoul as to the point of Juſtification. When <hi>Abraham</hi> went up into the mountain to offer up his ſon, he ſpake to his ſervants to ſtay below,<note place="margin">

And ſo when a man goes up into this hil of juſtification, this high mountain, he takes only his faith with him, and he ſayes unto all his works, and unto all his duties, ſtay you below at the bottom of the hil; and there they attend. So that faith, juſtifying faith, though it hath alwaies works, yet they come not into this matter of Juſtification. 'Tis Faith alone that juſtifies. This by way of Explication.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:162406:28"/>friend, but a real enemy unto all our Grace and Holineſſe, then Juſtification by faith alone is a friend to it. But now take the Law, and you ſhall find, that juſtification thereby, is no friend, but a real enemy unto all our Holineſs, and the power of godlineſs. What greater enemies had the world ever to the power of godlineſs, than the Jews were? and they ſought to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, and to be juſtified by the Law. And now a dayes, What more bitter, &amp; more fel enemy unto the power of godlineſs, than a Moral Civil man? Why? Becauſe though he do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand himſelf, yet he doth ſecretly ſeek his acceptance with God, by his own doing, and good meaning. A man can never live to God, that lives in himſelf: So long as a man ſeeks Juſtification by his own doing, &amp; working, he lives in himſelf. Therefore ſaies the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9.</note> 
                  <hi>I deſire not to be found in mine own righteouſneſs,</hi> to be found in it. Hope is the Spring of action. The Plow-man plowes in hope, &amp; he ſows in hope; Hope is the Spring of action. Now if a man ſeeks to be juſtified by the Law, or the works of the Law, there is no hope; for all works are imperfect: and if no hope, (ſaies the ſoul) why ſhould I work? as good never a whit, as never the better. That cannot be the Principle of our grace and holineſs, which can neither Convert a man, nor mortifie his ſins, nor quicken one to what is good, nor comfort, or free him from temptation. Now I pray, What is it that <hi>Converts</hi> a ſoul to Chriſt? is it the Law, or the preaching of the Law? Nay,<note place="margin">

And as for <hi>Mortification of ſin:</hi> Can the Law do that? Nay, (ſaies the Apoſtle in the 8. of the <hi>Romans</hi>) <hi>The Law is weak: What the Law could not do, being weak, God ſent his own Son, to condemn ſin in the fleſh.</hi> So that the Law cannot mortifie ſin, the Law cannot do it.

Nay, (ſaies the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>The Law is a dead letter;</hi> and, <hi>the Law is the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death:</hi> And can that which is a dead letter, and the miniſtraction of death, quicken us unto what is good? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it cannot. And as for our Temptations, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from them; Does the <hi>Law</hi> do that? Ye know, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle triumphs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33</note> 
                  <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> And who ſhall lay any thing to may charge? ſhall the Anger, and Wrath of God? ſhall Satan, or mine own Conſcience? I will not be much afflicted (ſaies he:) why? for, <hi>It is God that juſtifies.</hi> He does not ſay, for it is <hi>Moſes</hi> that juſtifies: but 'tis Chriſt that died, and God juſtifies, not <hi>Moſes. Sampſon</hi> (ye know) found honey-combs in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the dead lyon; not in hives at home, or trees abroad; but he found honey-combs in the body of the dead lyon. So does a poor tempted ſoul find all the honey-combs of comfort, in the body of the dead Lyon of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> not in his own hive. I have read of a certain man, that was much in prayer, faſting, and reading; and the Devil came to him and told him, Friend, Why doeſt thou Pray ſo much, and Reade ſo much, and Faſt ſo much? 'tis all to n purpoſe, for thou ſhalt go to Hell at the laſt, thou ſhalt never go to Heaven: Saies he, As for that, I leave that to God; it is not my Queſtion, whether I ſhall go to Heaven, or Hell: but my Queſtion is, How ſhall I ſerve God, and live to God? Had he now ſought Juſtification in a away of <hi>works,</hi> and by the <hi>Law;</hi> could he have ever bin able to have anſwered to this temptation? Ye may ſee what the Apoſtle ſaies, in the 7. chap. of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans;</hi> he gives you a Similitude thus: As a woman; ſo is the ſould of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man: So long as a woman is married unto one man, ſhe brings forth children unto him, and not unto any other, but is dead unto all others: but when that man dies, ſhe is free to marry; and ſhe marries another, and ſhe brings forth children unto him. Now ſaies the Apoſtle (at the 4. verſe.) <hi>Wherefore my brethren, ye alſo are become dead to the Law by the body of Chriſt, that ye ſhould be married to another, even to him,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:162406:29"/>who is raiſed from the dead, that we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God.</hi> So that ſo long as a man, is married to the Law, he can never bring forth fruit unto God. Now then, thus lies the Reaſon: If that the Law, and Juſtification thereby, be no Friend, but a real Enemy unto all our Holineſs: then (contraries having contrarie conſequences) Juſtification by faith alone is a friend, and no Enemy unto our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life and Holineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Seondly. This alſo will appear, if ye conſider the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel between the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> Chriſt is our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam. Now ſaies the Apoſtle in the 5. of the <hi>Romans, As by the ſin of one, death came upon all men to condemnation: ſo by the Righteouſneſs of one, life comes unto many.</hi> Well, but how came condemnation upon all men by the ſin of one? The firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> he was a common perſon, he did ſtand for all mankind; when he ſinned, all mankind ſinned: and therefore aſſoon as any one is born, the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> being imputed to him <hi>judicially;</hi> that imputation is the origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of all the Unholineſs that is among the children of men. So our Lord and Savior Jeſus Chriſt, being our ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> he is a Common perſon, ſtands in the room of al the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; he was obedient, not for Himſelf, but for Them; <hi>Chriſtus non meruit ſibi.</hi> Obeyed not for Himſelf: and he died not for himſelf, but for them, righteous for them. When therefore, a man is born into the world, is regenerate by faith? then all that Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, the ſecond Adam, is imputed to him.</p>
               <p>And this imputation of his Righteouſneſs by faith, is the original of all that Holineſs that is in our lives, thus: As al the Unholineſs, and Wickedneſs that is in the world, does flow from the imputation of the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> ſin: So al that grace and holineſs that is in the world, does flow from the imputation of the ſecond Adams Righteouſneſs. Now by faith alone, this Righteouſnes is imputed, and does become ours, and therefore, Juſtification by faith alone, is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and original of all our grace and holineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly. If free-remiſſion of ſin, and the ſence thereof,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:162406:30"/>be the cauſe of our Holineſs: then Juſtification by faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone muſt needs be a friend unto it. For theſe Two, Free-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin, and juſtification by faith alone, go together, and are ordinarily taken for one. And therefore, in the 3. of the <hi>Romans,</hi> The Apoſtle having ſaid, (as the 24. verſe) <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace;</hi> he ſaies (at the 28. ver.) <hi>That a man is juſtified by faith:</hi> and ſaying, That a man is juſtified by faith, he ſaies, That a man is juſtified freely by grace; theſe are put together. Now, Free-remiſſion of ſin, and the ſence thereof, is the Cauſe of al our Holineſs. Ye know what the Apoſtle ſaies,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>The grace of God hath appeared unto all men, teaching us to deny <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs, and worldly luſts, and to live righteouſly, and ſoberly in this preſent world.</hi> All Holineſs comes from thence, The apparition of grace, Free-remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin. And ye know what it is that doth hatch the Chicken: 'tis not the fire that does hatch the Chicken; nor is it the cold water that does hatch the Chicken; but lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the eggs under the warm feathers of the living Hen. Come to a man or woman that hath many eggs that are yet not Chickens, within a month or two, theſe are al become living Chickens: Say you, How comes it to paſs, that all theſe are now living Chickens? What! did you lay theſe eggs unto the fire? No, for then they would have been roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. What! did you lay theſe eggs in the cold water? No, then they would have rotted; but I laid them under the warm wings of the living Hen, and ſo they are become chickens. So you come to a living ſoul, a living heart, and you ſay, Friend, how came you to be thus enlivened, and quickned? a month or two ago, I heard you complaining of your dead heart, Oh! my heart is dead: but how came you to be thus enlivened, and to be thus quickned? Did you go and lay your heart againſt the fire of the Law? No, that would have ſcorch'd me, and tormented me. What? did you go and lay your heart in the cold world? No? that would have rotted me: How then? Truly, after all my fears, and after all my doubtings, I went and laid my cold heart under the warm wings of Divine-love, and ſo it
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:162406:30"/>came to paſs that I am thus enlivened, and I am thus quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, as you ſee this day, for the which I bleſſe the Lord for ever. Three things there are, that do make up a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Converſation: Repentance for ſin paſt; Mortification of ſin preſent; and the Obedience of faith, or Obedience.</p>
               <p>Now as for <hi>Repentance:</hi> look I pray what is ſaid in the 7. Chapter of <hi>Luke,</hi> and ſee what is the Cauſe of that: You reade there a ſtory of a great Sinner, that became a great Penitent, (at the 37. verſe.) <hi>Behold a woman in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which was a great ſinner; and ſhe came and ſtood behind Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> (at the 38. verſe) <hi>weeping, and began to waſh his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head. She wept much;</hi> Why? <hi>for</hi> (ſaies the text at the latter end of the Chapter) <hi>ſhe loved much.</hi> But why did ſhe love much? She loved much, <hi>becauſe much was forgiven her.</hi> So then, Remiſſion is the Cauſe of Repentance. And have ye not ſo much expreſly, in that 16. Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and the laſt verſe. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with thee, that thou maieſt remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified towards thee, for all that thou haſt done.</hi> So that, this ſhame, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence comes from pacification. And as for this matter, <hi>Luther</hi> had ſo great a fight into it, that (ſaies he) before I was juſtified by faith alone, and ſaw into this matter of Free-remiſſion; I look't upon that word, <hi>Repent,</hi> as a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible word, I did even hate that word; and I wiſh't that there had been no ſuch word in all the book of God: but after once that word, <hi>juſtitia,</hi> was opened, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith; and after once I underſtood this Doctrine of Free-remiſſion, and Juſtification by faith alone, then I loved Repentance.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Mortification of ſin:</hi> Ye know what the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>Let not ſin raign in your mortal bodies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12. &amp; 14.</note> 
                  <hi>or have dominion over you:</hi> why? <hi>for ye are not under the Law, but under grace.</hi> So then, 'tis being under grace that does mortifie ſin.</p>
               <p>And as for the matter of <hi>Obedience:</hi> Ye know what the Pſalmiſt ſaies, <hi>There is mercy with thee, O Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130 4</note> 
                  <hi>that thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:162406:31"/>be feared:</hi> That is, that thou maieſt be <hi>Served,</hi> that thou maieſt be <hi>Obeyed.</hi> So that, Obedience alſo, comes from the ſight of mercy, and of Free-remiſſion.</p>
               <p>Now, if Free-remiſſion and the ſence thereof be the Cauſe of our Holineſſe, then ſurely, Juſtification by faith alone, can be no Enemy, but muſt needs be a real friend unto all our ſpiritual life.</p>

                  </label> For Anſwer, Ye muſt know that the word <hi>Law,</hi> in the new Teſtament is taken Two waies: Either it is taken for the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> thus: If you keep the Ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements perfectly, you ſhall live for ever; this is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works; Somtimes the Law is taken for the <hi>Ten Commandements,</hi> the Rule of mans life. In the firſt ſence a Chriſtian is dead vnto the Law, and is freed from it: but in the ſecond ſence, a Beleever, a Juſtified perſon, is more bound to the Law, to obſerve it as a Rule of life, than ever he was. Onely you muſt know, there is a Twofold <hi>Bond:</hi> There is the bond of <hi>Love;</hi> and there is the bond of <hi>Fear:</hi> as there is the <hi>Law</hi> of Love; and the <hi>Law</hi> of Fear. Love, and the bond of Love; is ſtronger than Fear, and the bond of Fear: for Fear is ſervant to Love, Fear is the hand maid to Love; for ye never Fear the loſing of any good thing, but what ye firſt Love; Fear is the ſervant to Love, and therefore Love is ſtronger than Fear, and the bond of Love ſtronger than the bond of Fear. Now though a Juſtified perſon be not bound unto the Law, with the bond of a <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile-Fear;</hi> yet he is bound unto the Law, with the bond of <hi>Love;</hi> and ſo he is more obedient, as the bond of Love, is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:162406:31"/>ſtronger than the bond of Fear. A man muſt needs be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto Chriſt, that takes himſelf to be none of his own, but Chriſts. Therfore ſaies the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20</note> 
                  <hi>Glorify Chriſt with your body, becauſe ye are bought with a price, and becauſe ye are Gods.</hi> So long as a man ſeeks to be juſtified by works, and by the Law, ſo long he looks upon himſelf as his own: but when a man ſees that he is juſtified by faith alone, then he looks upon himſelf as Chriſts; that he is not his own, and ſo he is more obedient unto Chriſt than ever be was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

I may ask you the reaſon likewiſe: But I wil tel you the reaſon; the reaſon of this is, Becauſe men are contrary unto God; and all that do make this uſe &amp; application of the Lords mercy and grace, they are contrary unto God; for God works good out of evil: Now a wicked man being contrary unto God, he works evil out of good.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:162406:32"/>our Holineſs? how comes it to paſſe? what is there in this, that hath ſuch an influence upon our lives, to make us the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the more heavenly?</hi>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> Firſt. The more a man does forſake any good thing of his own for Chriſt, the more Chriſt is engaged to give a man his good things. There is no loſing, in loſing for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: what ye loſe for Chirſt, ye ſhal gain by Chriſt: And the greater, and ſweeter any bleſſing is that ye loſe for Chriſt, the greater bleſſing will Chriſt give unto ye in the room thereof. Now what neerer thing is there to a man, than his own Righteouſneſs? In Juſtification by faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, a man laies down al his own Righteouſneſs at the feet of Jeſus Chriſt; and therfore Chriſt is engaged to give him a better Righteouſneſs, the Righteouſneſs of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly. God does never cauſe any man to paſſe under any <hi>Relation,</hi> but he does write the <hi>Law</hi> of that Relation upon his heart. For example, If the Lord does cauſe a man to paſſe under the Relation of a <hi>Magiſtrate:</hi> God wil write the <hi>Law</hi> of that Relation upon him, and give him ability to it. If God doe cauſe a man to paſſe under the Relation of a <hi>Miniſter;</hi> God will write the <hi>Law</hi> of that Relation on him. If God do cauſe a man to paſſe under the Relation of a <hi>Husband,</hi> or a <hi>Father;</hi> God will cauſe the <hi>Law</hi> of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to be written upon his heart. Now when a man is juſtified by faith alone, then he becomes the Son of God; <hi>To as many as receive him, he gives power to be called the Sons of God; even to as many as beleeve on his Name. John,</hi> 1.12. I ſay When a man is juſtified by faith alone, he becomes the Son of God, he paſſes under that Relation; therefore then does the Lord write the <hi>Law</hi> of that Relation of a Son upon his heart, and thereby he is made more Son-like by his obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly. The more a man does agree with God and the Law, the more fit he is to walk with God, and obſerve the Law. when a man is juſtified by faith, then he is agreed with God:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Amos</hi> 3.3</note> 
                  <hi>Can two walk together, unleſs they be agreed?</hi> Now when a man is juſtified by faith, he is <hi>Reconciled</hi> to God;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:162406:32"/>reconciled to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God; reconciled to the <hi>Anger</hi> of God; reconciled to the <hi>Law</hi> of God, the Law is his friend. Now before a man was juſtified, the <hi>Anger</hi> of God was his enemy, and the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God his enemy, and the <hi>Law</hi> his enemy; but now being juſtified, he is reconciled to God: reconciled to his <hi>Anger;</hi> that is ſatisfied by Chriſt: recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the <hi>Law;</hi> that is ſatisfied by Chriſt; thus he is made a friend to God, he is agreed with God, and with the Law, and ſo he can walk with God, and ſo he is the more obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But Fourthly (and eſpecially) thus: As by <hi>Works,</hi> and ſeeking Juſtification by <hi>Works,</hi> a man is Eſtated in the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works:</hi> So by <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſeeking Juſtification by <hi>Faith</hi> alone, a man is Eſtated in the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> When a man is Eſtated in the Covenant of grace, God is engaged to give grace unto him, to make him Holy. For that, I pray do but reade what ye have in that 36. Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> at the 25. verſe, and ſo downwards: <hi>Then will I ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean: from all your filthineſs, and from all your idols will I cleanſe you. A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I wil give you an heart of fleſh: And I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes; and ye ſhall keep my judgments and do them.</hi> Firſt, I pray mark here, That the Lord does promiſe Remiſſion of ſin, although it be never ſo great: <hi>I will ſprinkle clean water upon you, and waſh ye from all your filthineſs, and from all your i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols wil I cleanſe you.</hi> But ſaies a poor doubting ſoul, Though the Lord do thus waſh me, I am ſo foule, and ſo unclean, that I am afraid I ſhall never be cleanſed. Yes, (ſaies the Lord) I will ſprinkle clean water upon you, <hi>and ye ſhall be clean.</hi> But though I be clean, and cleanſed from my guilt, and my ſin pardoned; yet notwithſtanding, I have ſuch a naughty, filthy heart, as I ſhall foul my ſelf again. See what follows, <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you.</hi> Oh! but my heart is ſo hard, like a ſtone, that I ſhall reſiſt this mercy of God. Nay (ſaies he)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:162406:33"/>
                  <hi>And I will take away the ſtony heart cut of your fleſh:</hi> I will take away the <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> the ſtony heart out of your fleſh. But though it be ſo; as long as my nature is unchanged, I ſhal never do that which is right. Saies God, I will change your nature for you; I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and <hi>I will give you an heart of fleſh.</hi> I wil make ſuch a change in you, That whereas before, Naturally, ye were as hard as a ſtone, now I wil make you as ſoft as fleſh. But though the Lord do thus change my Nature, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, I ſhall never be able to order my converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aright, I ſhall never be obedient. Mark what follows, <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and I will cauſe you to walk in my Statutes:</hi> I will make you obedient, ſaies God. Oh! what ſtreams of mercy are here! But I pray, mind the Fountain whence theſe flow; They al flow from this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Free-remiſſion: The firſt is, <hi>I will ſprinkle clean wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon you, and cleanſe you from all your idols:</hi> I will forgive you freely. I but, though this be ſet firſt, it may be this is not the Cauſe of the reſt, how ſhal it appear, that this Free-remiſſion is the Cauſe of all our holineſs? Then (I pray) look into the 8. chap. of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> (where this Covenant of grace is repeated) at the 10. verſe, <hi>For this is the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, I will put my laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts: and they ſhall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord: for all ſhall know me, from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> Why? <hi>for I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins, and their iniquities will I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber no more.</hi> So that Remiſſion is the Cauſe of Sanctification: I will thus and thus ſanctifie, ſaies the Lord; <hi>For I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and iniquities will I remember no more:</hi> this is the Cauſe of all that. Now I ſay, When a man is once eſtated in this Covenant of grace, the Lord (ye ſee) is engaged then for to make him holy. And as by <hi>works,</hi> and ſeeking Juſtification by works, a man is eſtated in the <hi>Covenant of works:</hi> So by <hi>faith,</hi> and ſeeking Juſtification by <hi>faith</hi> alone, a man is eſtated in the <hi>Covenant
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:162406:33"/>of grace;</hi> and ſo the Lord is engaged for to make him holy. So that, thus you ſee now, This Free-grace of God, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a poor ſinner by faith alone, it is no enemy, but a real friend unto all our Holineſs, and Spiritual life. No wonder therefore, that the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>And now I live.</hi>

                  </label> Beloved! There is nothing little between God and a gracious ſoul. There is nothing ſmal that comes from God to you, becauſe it comes from an infinite God: There is nothing ſmal that goes from a gracious ſoul unto God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, becauſe it comes from an infinite deſire of pleaſing God. It is one thing to be more in the Shell, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to be more in the Kernel. <hi>Luther</hi> profeſſes, that when he was a <hi>Monke</hi> (as it ſeems by his writings he was fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years in a Cloyſter.) Saies he, When I was a <hi>Monke,</hi> I was a great deal more Holy then, according to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, than I am now: then I <hi>Prayed,</hi> and then I <hi>Faſted,</hi> and then I <hi>Macerated</hi> my body, and then I went meanly; but now I <hi>Eat,</hi> and I <hi>Drink,</hi> and I <hi>Cloath</hi> my ſelf as others do; and yet now one little Prayer, is more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:162406:35"/>with God, than all my fifteen years Prayers before: why? becauſe (ſaies he) then I prayed in a way of Works, and ſought Juſtification in a way of Works; but now I have had a taſte of this Juſtification by faith alone, and a little from thence is more pleaſing unto the Lord, then all the fifteen years before.</p>
               <p>But who ever you are that make this Objection, Give me leave to propound theſe Two Queſtions to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Whereas you ſay, It is little, and therefore you fear it cannot come from ſo full a fountain: Doeſt thou ſtint, or limit thy ſelf in thy Obedience, or in thy Holineſs? A man that ſeeks to be juſtified, and ſaved by his working, he does ſtint, and limit himſelf: I have enough (ſaies he) for to bring me to heaven, and what need I more? a great many are very preciſe, and ſtrict, but I praiſe the Lord, I have enough for to bring me to heaven, and what need I more? So he ſtints, and limits himſelf. And I have been Weeping, and Mourning enough for to get forgiveneſſe, and the Lord now hath forgiven me, and what need I more? Thus he ſtints, and limits himſelf, becauſe he is under the Law, and under a Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Again, Though your Obedience as you think is very little, and very ſmall: Do you oppoſe thoſe that have much? do you oppoſe thoſe that have the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs? and thoſe that have more than your ſelf? A man that ſeeks Juſtification by Works, he does oppoſe thoſe men that have more Holineſs than himſelf. See I pray, how it was with the <hi>Jews</hi> in that 9. of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the 31. verſ. <hi>But</hi> Iſrael <hi>which followed after the Law of righteouſneſs, hath not attained to the Law of righteouſneſſe: Wherefore? Becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the Law: for they ſtumbled at that ſtumbling ſtone.</hi> They ſtumbled at Chriſt, they ſtumbled at Chriſtianity, they ſtumbled at the corner ſtone. And ſo now, <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> men, that ſeek acceptance (though they do not underſtand themſelves) in a way of working; they oppoſe thoſe that are more godly that have the power of godlineſs. But ye know, a ſpark
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:162406:35"/>of fire, though it be but a ſpark of fire, it will not oppoſe the flame; though it be not ſo great as the flame, yet it will not oppoſe the flame: it oppoſes the water, but it doth not oppoſe the flame of fire. And ſo, if a man have grace, though it be but a ſpark of grace, yet notwithſtanding, if it be in truth, it will not oppoſe a flame: But now <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> men, that walk in a way of works, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; Oh! how do they oppoſe thoſe that have the power of godlineſs! that have more grace than themſelves! that are in a flame for Chriſt! them they oppoſe. Is it ſo with you that make this Objection? Oh! No, I praiſe the Lord (your ſoul will ſay, if it ſpeak in truth) though I have but little, the Lord knows, I do not oppoſe them that have much: I rejoyce rather in thoſe that have more than my ſelf, yea, I rejoyce in thoſe that have the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. And Lord! thou knoweſt, I do not ſtint, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſelf: Oh! I can never be godly enough, and I can never Repent enough, and I can never mourn for my ſins e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: Well, be of good comfort, this may be no other ſtream, then what flows from this bleſſed fountain, Free-remiſſion, and Juſtification by faith alone.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly. When there is a meeting of all graces, and one good work, and duty, and grace, is reconciled to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a mans life; is there not then a taſt, and a ſavour of Juſtification and Free-remiſſion? When the Lord does ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie a poor ſinner, then al the Attributes of God are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to one another; Juſtice is reconciled to Mercy; and Mercy is reconciled to Juſtice: and all theſe reconciled At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of the Lord, do meet upon the ſoul of a juſtified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and accordingly, there is a meeting of all graces in the ſoul, and all good works, and graces, they are reconciled to one another: That whereas before a man was juſtified, they were at ods, at a diſtance one from another, and were ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mititious one to another; now they are not. Whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man was juſtified, he could not rejoyce in God, but it hindred his mourning for ſin; and he could not mourn for ſin, but it hindred his faith; and he could not beleeve, but his beleeving hindred his repentance. But now, when a man is juſtified, and reconciled to the Lord, then all thoſe Works, Duties, and Graces, are reconciled to one another. Why? Becauſe the Attributes of God are reconciled unto one another, and all the Attributes of God, they meet upon the heart of a juſtified perſon, and ſo there are the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of his Juſtification upon his Sanctification here. And I appeal to ye, who ever you are that labor under this ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:162406:36"/>Is it not thus with thy ſoul in truth? Do not you find it thus? That now you look upon the very Juſtice of the Lord, as your friend, the Juſtice, and Righteouſneſs of the Lord as your friend? That now ye are reconcil'd (as it were) to thoſe Duties, that heretofore you looked upon as your Enemies? That now you reſt upon the Lord Chriſt, that you may be Obedient; and your very reſting upon Chriſt, makes you obedient? your very beholding of Chriſt, changes you <hi>from glory to glory:</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18</note> If you would ſpeak in truth from your ſoul, you would ſay thus; Lord! thus 'tis with me: Now I am reconciled to that Duty that before was an enemy to me, and now theſe Workes, Duties, and Graces are reconciled: for now, the more I can rejoyce in God, the more I can mourn for ſin; and the more I Beleeve, the more I can Repent: Heretofore, the more I Beleeved, the leſſe I Repented, my Beleeving was my Security; but now I ſee theſe works, and Duties, are friends to one another, that now, the more I Repent, the more I Beleeve; and the more I Beleeve, the more I Repent, all theſe works are reconciled in me. And Lord, thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt, That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I grieve for my ſins, becauſe thou haſt pardoned them: and therefore I deſire to obey thee, becauſe thou haſt forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me. Well then, here are the Viſible Characters of thy Juſtification, upon thy Sanctification, And therefore be of good comfort notwithſtanding this Objection.</p>
               <p>Only let me tell thee this: It may be thou haſt not ſtood enough at a diſtance from thy own Doings, and Duties, as to the matter of thy Acceptance with God. But, would you be more Spiritual, and Holy in your lives? labour more and more, to ſtand at a diſtance from all your Duties and Doings, as to the great matter of your Acceptance with God the father.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Some things by way of Anſwer to this, and ſo I have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Be ye humbled in the ſight and preſence of the Lord, that you have walked in that way, that you have tied Jeſus Chriſt unto your conditions, and that you have made uſe of Chriſt, only to eek out your Performance, as to the matter of your Acceptance.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Study much the Tranſactions of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God the Father and Jeſus Chriſt. And then you will find, That Jeſus Chriſt had ſatisfied God the Father, before ever you came into the world: and therefore your ſouls when you think of this will ſay, How therefore can my Work, or my Duty, any way bring in Satisfaction, or Acceptance with God the Father. Study (I ſay) the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions between God the Father and Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Acquaint your ſoul much, with the difference between the Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace. In the Covenant of Works, a mans Work is firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and then his Perſon: But in the Covenant of Grace, a mans Perſon is firſt accepted, and then his Work. And when you underſtand this, then you will ſay, I, if this be true, That a mans Perſon is firſt accepted, and then his Work, How can my Work any way fetch me in acceptance with God the Father? O my ſoul, for ever ſtand clear in this great matter of my Acceptance in my Duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, when ever your Duties, your Works, and your Graces, are Higheſt, then, and then eſpecially, uſe thy ſoul to be beyond them; and ſay thus: Though now (I bleſſe the Lord) my heart is thus and thus Inlarged, yet I do not count upon my Acceptance, by reaſon of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largment. Though (I bleſſe the Lord) I have now Prayer, that before had none: yet I do not count my Acceptance with God the Father by this Prayer. When (I ſay) thy Duty is Higheſt, uſe thy ſoul to be beyond it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, When your Duty, Grace, and Holineſs is low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:162406:37"/>then know, that now ye have an opportunity to ſtand clear from your own Duties, and Workings, as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your Acceptance, and Juſtification by faith alone. If I have a friend in my houſe, that lives in my houſe with me, whom I would not have privy unto a Work, or a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; I'le take the opportunity to do the Work, when that friend is out of doors: now (ſay I) he is abroad; if he were at home, he would be prying over my ſhoulder, and he would have a ſinger in the buſineſs, and he would ſee it; but now he is abroad, now I will take the time to do it. My brethren, your Duties, Prayer, and Humiliation, they are all friends to your Juſtification: but when Prayer is out, and Duty is out, and abroad, and out of ſight, and not at home; Now take your time to be clear in the matter of neſting upon Chriſt ad one, and ſay, Now my Prayer is gone, and Duties gone, and all out of ſight, Oh! Lord, now I have an opportunity to reſt upon Chriſt alone: had my Prayer been at home, and Duties at home; they would have been peering, and prying into this Work, but now they are all out of ſight, now I will reſt upon Chriſt, and his righteouſneſs alone. This is certain, that this Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith alone, and Free-remiſſion of a poor ſinner, 'tis the great fountain and principle of all our Grace and Holineſs: and therefore, if you would be more Gracious, and more Holy; I beſeech ye in the Name of Chriſt, ſtudy it much, and walk in the ſence of it. And what's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that many Profeſſors are no more Holy, and Humble; but waſpiſh, and peeviſh, and harſh, and of a rugged diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition? but becauſe they have not ſtudied the Goſpel more, and Free-remiſſion, and Juſtification by faith alone, and they have not the ſence of this upon then hearts; poor ſouls, you want the Experience of this: you think (ſome of you) there is no ſuch way to be Holy, and Gracious, as to have Legal-breakings, to have the Law preſt upon you: but I do here tell you in the Name of the Lord, and I lie not, That Juſtification by faith alone, and Free-remiſſion, is the principle of all our Obedience, and all our Holineſs. And
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:162406:38"/>when <hi>Paul</hi> came to this, and the ſence of this, Now I live, (ſaies he.) And ſo wilt thou ſay, (poor foul) when thou comeſt to the ſence of this Truth; I was dead before, but now I live: indeed, I was down, and my heart dead, when I hung upon my owne Duties, but now I live. Now there fore, as you deſire to live, and liue ſpiritually, the Lord give you hearts to live in the ſence and experience of this great Truth, <hi>Juſtification, and Free-remiſſion by faith alone.</hi>

               <p>The way of the Goſpel, is a <hi>Self-denying</hi> way. Though a Beleever, that ſeeks Juſtification by faith alone, and not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:162406:39"/>by the Works of the Law, does live a ſpiritual life, and ſo does act, move, and work towards God: yet he cannot endure to write an I, upon his own Performance. <hi>Yet not I.</hi> He will <hi>Obey</hi> God: but he will not have an I, to be written upon his Obedience.

And thus it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> in regard of his own Perſon, as ye reade in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. chapter, ſpeaking with relation unto the other Apoſtles (at the 10. verſe) <hi>I laboured more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> I laboured more abundantly than they all, <hi>yet not I.</hi> I have been a Preacher of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and have been a means to convert many ſouls unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; <hi>Yet not I, but the grace of God with me.</hi> I have comforted many Afflicted ſouls; <hi>yet not I.</hi> I have been a means to plant many Churches; <hi>Yet not I, but the grace of God with me.</hi> He will not have his work defil'd with Self, or this I to be written upon what he doth.

                  </label> Ye know, that there is a Three-fold Self mentioned by Divines. A <hi>Natural</hi> Self: as, a mans Parts, Wit, Reaſon, Will, Affections, and Inclination, are called ones Self. Then there is a <hi>Sinful</hi> Self: and ſo a mans Corruption, Luſt, and Sinful Diſpoſition, is called ones Self. And then
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:162406:39"/>there is a <hi>Religious</hi> Self: and ſo a mans Duties, Graces, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs, are called ones Self. Now though a man is to deny all theſe; yet I am not at this time to ſpeak of the Common-place of Self-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, this Scripture does not lead me to it: but only of Self-Denial in Spiritual things, Denial of Religious Self. There is a great difference between a mans denying of his Sinful, and of his Religious Self. When a man does deny his Sinful Self for Chriſt; then he is wholly to leave, and forſake his ſin, and that Self. But when a man is to deny his Religious Self for Chriſt; he is not to leave, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his Duty: only, in point of Juſtification, he is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all; and in point of Sanctification, he is to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the ſtrength, the power, and the glory of all his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Duties, unto Jeſus Chriſt, and to himſelf nothing: and when a man in point of Juſtification, does renounce all; and in point of Sanctification, does attribute the ſtrength, the power, and the glory of all unto Jeſus Chriſt, and unto himſelf nothing; then he denies himſelf in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things.</p>
               <p>For there is a Two-fold denial of ones ſelf, even in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things. One that is oppoſed to <hi>Self-Seeking:</hi> And another that is oppoſed to <hi>Self-Advancing.</hi> When a man ſeeks himſelf, he makes himſelf his End: When a man does Advance himſelf, he makes himſelf his Prey. Now though a man be to deny himſelf in oppoſition to all Self-Seeking; yet that is not the Argument that lies here, it is not the Argument of this Scripture; but a man is called upon by this Scripture, to deny himſelf in oppoſition to Self-Advancing: <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet again, (that we may rightly underſtand things) Though every Beleever is to deny himſelf in ſpiritual things, and ſo to depreſs himſelf; yet notwithſtanding, he is not to ſpeak evil of the grace of God within him. For, there are Two things in every Duty, or Service. There is ſomething of Gods; &amp; ſomething of a mans own: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Spirit of God, ſomthing of a mans own. Now
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:162406:40"/>though a man may trample upon all his Duties, and upon all his Graces, as to the point of Juſtification; yet as to the point of Sanctification, he may not miſ-cal the Graces of God in him, and his Duties, ſaying, Theſe are nothing but the fruits of Hypocriſy; for then he ſhould ſpeak evil of the Spirit, whoſe works they are. A man tramples, and treads upon the Dirt; but he will not trample upon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, upon Gold and Silver; why? becauſe that is a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mettal, or hath the ſtamp, or the image of the Prince up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. Now, our own Duties, our own Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs, as to the matter of Juſtification, they are nothing worth, and ſo we trample upon all: but as to the matter of Sanctification, they have the image of Chriſt upon them, they are precious mettal; and therefore, for a man to ſay, This is Hypocriſie, and all is nothing but Hypocriſie; this is not Self-Denial: properly, Self-Denial in Spiritual things is; as to the matter of Juſtification, to renounce all; and as to the matter of Sanctification, to attribute the ſtrength, the power, and the glory of all, unto Jeſus Chriſt, and to ones ſelf nothing: and when a man does attribute all the ſtrength, the power, the glory of all to Jeſus Chriſt, and to himſelf nothing; then he is ſaid to deny himſelf in Spiritual things. This by way of Explication.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> If the Law, and the preaching of the Law cannot make a man to deny himſelf in Spiritual things, then the Goſpel muſt do it: for this grace is to be obtained, and found ſome where, ſomething muſt work it. Now the Law, and the preaching of the Law, can never make a man to <hi>Deny</hi> himſelf in Spiritual things; but rather it will make a man to <hi>Seek</hi> himſelf in Spiritual things: For, what is it to preach the Law: but when I ſhall come from God, and tell ye, That if ye do keep the Ten Commandements, and fail in nothing; ye ſhall be Saved: but if ye fail in any one point ye ſhall be Damned, and loſt for ever: This will not make a man to <hi>Deny</hi> his own Righteouſneſs, but rather to <hi>Seek</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:162406:40"/>himſelf, his own Salvation, to avoid Damnation, and ſeek himſelf in Spiritual things. But now, when I come to ye, and ſpeak thus unto ye from the Lord, That if you do throw down all your own Righteouſneſs, at the feet of Chriſt, and reſt only upon him; ye ſhall be ſaved: this will make a man to deny all his own Righteouſneſs, and deny himſelf in Spiritual things: and this is the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And the Goſpel muſt needs do it. For, what is the Goſpel? but the Voyce of Chriſt, the Preachings, and the Sermons of Chriſt? Now look as it was with the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> the firſt leſſon, that the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> did learn, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and teach his poſterity, was, To Advance himſelf in Spiritual things.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>The day that thou eateſt</hi> (ſaies Satan to him) <hi>thou ſhalt not die; but thine eyes ſhall be opened, and thou ſhalt be as God.</hi> Which he beleeved, and did eat, and ſo laboured to Advance himſelf in Spiritual things: The firſt leſſon, that ever he learn'd, and taught his poſterity, was, to Advance himſelf. So the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> the firſt leſſon that ever the Second <hi>Adam</hi> (Chriſt) put in practice, was Self-Denial in Spiritual things.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7.</note> For (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>He thought it no robbery to be equal with God, and yet humbled himſelf unto the form of a ſervant, and became of no reputation.</hi> This was the firſt thing. Now (I ſay) the Goſpel is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the Voyce of Chriſt, the Sermons, and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings of Jeſus Chriſt the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> and there, and there only, is this leſſon to be learned.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly. Every Godly, Gracious man, that lives under the Goſpel, Is of a ſpirit, and diſpoſition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the world. This is the diſpoſition of the world, To write an I upon what they do. Ye know what that proud King ſaid, <hi>Have not I built this great</hi> Babel,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Luke,</hi> 18.11, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of my Majeſtie?</hi> have not I built it? And ye know what the Legal-Phariſie ſaid, <hi>Lord, I thank thee, that I am not as other men; no Extortioner,</hi> and the like: I <hi>faſt,</hi> I <hi>pray,</hi> I <hi>give almes.</hi> He writes an I upon what he does. Now the ſpirit of a Beleever is contrary; and though a Beleever ſay, I pray, yet he will bite that I in again, and he will
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:162406:41"/>ſay, yet not <hi>I,</hi> but the grace of God within me. He is of a diſpoſition contrary unto that of the world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot write an I upon what he does.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Every Godly, Gracious man, that liveth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel; is very tender of trenching upon, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing contrary to Gods Prerogative, unto Chriſts Prerogative. This is the Prerogative of God, of Chriſt, to write an I upon what he does.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.19. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. <hi>Luke,</hi> 13.32</note> I <hi>create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace,</hi> ſaies God. I, <hi>even</hi> I <hi>am he.</hi> So in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Go</hi> (ſaies our Saviour Chriſt) <hi>tell that fox</hi> Herod, <hi>that</hi> I <hi>work to day, and to morrow.</hi> This is the great Prerogative of God, and of Chriſt, for to write an I upon what they do. Now Beleevers, they are very tender of doing any thing that may intrench upon Gods Prerogative, and therefore they cannot write an I upon what they do, but deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Spiritual things.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly. The more truly any man does Repent, the more ſenſible he is of his own Unworthineſs, and ſo the more Self-denying in Spiritual things. Ye know how it is with the Prodigal in the Parable, when he comes home, ſaies he upon his return,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke,</hi> 15 18, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>I will go unto my father, and I will ſay, I am not worthy to be called thy ſon, make me as one of thy hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſervants.</hi> In my fathers houſe there is bread, and I'le go home, and be contented to be one of my fathers, hired-ſervants. Before he went out, no Room in his fathers houſe was good enough for him; but now upon his return, any room in his fathers houſe is good enough. Before he went out, No Diet, no meat and drink in his fathers houſe would ſerve his turn, but away he goes: but now in his return, In my fathers houſe there is bread enough (ſaith he) And let me be as one of thy hired ſeruants. Thus ſenſible of his own unworthyneſs, and with ſelf deniall. Why? becauſe now Repentance had taken hold on his heart. Well, the more therefore a man does Repent, the more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible he is of his own unworthyneſs, and the more he will deny himſelf in Spiritual things. But I pray what is it that does cauſe true Repentance? Is it the Goſpel? or is it the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:162406:41"/>Law? Nay, not the Law, but the Goſpel. Ye know what <hi>John</hi> ſaid, ye know what our Savior ſaid, and ye know what the Apoſtle ſaid (for they all preach the ſame things, the ſame words) <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> They do not ſay, Repent, for the kingdom of <hi>Hell</hi> is at hand; repent, or ye ſhall be damn'd: but, repent, for the kingdom of Grace, Mercy, and of Free-remiſſion is at hand. So that it is the Goſpel that does work Repentance, and therefore it is the Goſpel, and the Goſpel only, that does make a man ſenſible of his own unworthineſs, and to deny himſelf in ſpiritual things.</p>

                  </label> For Anſwer, I grant ye, that the very Heathen, Papiſts, and Moral men, have ſpoken much, and written much, concerning Humility, and Self-Denial: and have ſeemed to go far in the practice of it. I have read of ſome Papiſts, that have been ſo abſtenious, that they have gone up and down from one Tavern to another, and from one Feaſt to another; and when men have been Eating and Drinking liberally, they have ſate down, abſteining from all Meats and Drinks, preſenting themſelves as patterns of Self-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial in the point of appetite.</p>
               <p>And indeed, we reade of Three Degrees, that the more moderate Papiſts do make of Self-Denial, and Humility. The firſt Degree (ſaies <hi>Granatenſis,</hi> and divers others) is, for a man to acknowledge, That all comes from God, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from himſelf. The Second Degree of Humility is, to acknowledge, That whatſoever a man hath from God, he hath it not from Merit, but from Grace, and meer Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The Third Degree of Humility or Self-Denial is, for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:162406:42"/>a man, To be Eagle-eyed, and quick ſighted, in beholding another mans excellency; but Mole-eyed, and not ſeeing his own Excellency. Even thus far the Papiſts. So that I grant, men may ſeem to go very far herein. But I ſpeak of Self-Denial in Spiritual things: and do we reade of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Heathen men, and the like; that do deny themſelves, (it may be in Words, but I ſay, in Practice) that do Deny, or have Denyed themſelves in Spiritual things?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Take a Moral, Civil man; and though he may ſeem to be very Humble, and Deny himſelf; yet he is proud of his Humility.

Take a Chriſtian, a Beleever &amp; I pray, do but obſerve a little, What a great Myſterie there is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:162406:42"/>in all his Humilitie, and Self-denial, wrought by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. As thus:</p>
               <p>He ever cries out What ſhall I do to be ſaved? what ſhall I do to be ſaved? And yet he profeſſes, That he does not expect to be ſaved by Doing. Here's a Myſterie!</p>
               <p>Again, He counts himſelf leſſe than the leaſt of all Gods mercies: And yet he thinks God hath done more for him, than if he had given him all the world. Here's a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie!</p>
               <p>Again, He prizes every Duties, and every Gift, and every Grace although it be never ſo ſmall; prizes it above all the world: And yet he counts al but dung and droſs in regard of Chriſt. Here's a Myſterie!</p>
               <p>Again, He looks upon himſelf as the greateſt ſinner, and thinks of every one better than himſelf: And yet when he looks upon a Drunkard, or a Swearer, or the like; profeſſes that he would not change his condition with him for al the world: He looks upon himſelf as the greateſt ſinner, and thinks of every one better than himſelf; and yet he ſaies concerning ſuch and ſuch, he would not change his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with them for al the world. What a Myſterie is this!</p>
               <p>Again, He mourns under Reproaches, and the Deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of men: And yet he triumphs over them, and is above them. Here's a Myſterie!</p>
               <p>Again, He counts himſelf nothing, and all that ever he does nothing: And yet he praiſes the Lord for every little, and thinks that God hath done more for him, in giving him Chriſt, than if he had given him all the world. Here's a Myſterie!</p>
               <p>Now, as for the ſeeming Humility, and Self-denial, that is in Heathen, or Moral, Civil men, there is none of this Myſtery: but there is a Spiritual Myſterie that runs along in the veins of all this Goſpel-Humility, and Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial.</p>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:162406:43"/>man, that was ſorely tempted by Satan, in his time: the man was much in Duty, and Satan comes unto him, and ſaies, Why doeſt thou take thus much pains? thou doeſt Faſt, and Watch; but, O man, what is there that thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt more than I do?

And know, a Chriſtian does not only go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Satan, but he goes beyond Moral, Civil, Legal men: and where ever the Goſpel comes in power, it works this diſpoſition and frame of heart, there it is wrought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, The more a man does ſee the Glory of God, the more Humble he will be, and Deny himſelf, even in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things. Ye may reade how it was with <hi>Job,</hi> in the 9. chapter of <hi>Job:</hi> ye do not reade in all that book, that <hi>Job</hi> does any where in one chapter, ſo much Deny himſelf, as concerning his own Righteouſneſs (which he ſtood much upon to his friends) as in this 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter, verſe the 15. <hi>Whom</hi> (ſpeaking of God) <hi>though I were righteous, yet I would not anſwer, but I would make ſupplication to my judge.</hi> Verſe the 16. <hi>If I had called, and he had anſwered me, yet would I not beleeve that he had hearkened unto my voice.</hi> Then at the 20. verſe. <hi>If I Juſtifie my ſelf, mine own mouth ſhall condemn me:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:162406:43"/>if I ſay I am perfect it ſhall alſo prove me perverſe.</hi> Verſe the 21. <hi>Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my ſoul: I would diſpiſe my life.</hi> Then at the 30. verſe. <hi>If I waſh my ſelf with ſnow water, and make my hands never ſo clean: yet ſhalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes ſhall abhor me.</hi> But whence did all this Self-Denial in Spiritual things proceed now? If you look into the former part of the chapter, ye ſhall ſee, that <hi>Job</hi> had a great proſpect of the glory of God. <hi>I know it is ſo of a truth: but how ſhould man be juſt with God?</hi> verſe the 2. <hi>If he will contend with him, he cannot anſwer him. God is wiſe in heart, and mighty in ſtrength:</hi> verſe the 4. Then verſe the 5. <hi>Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger. Which ſhaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. Which comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Sun, and it riſeth not: and ſealeth up the Stars. Which alone ſpreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the Sea. Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Plejades, and the chambers of the South. Which doth great things paſt finding out, yea, and wonders without number.</hi> And now having this proſpect of the Greatneſs, and Glory of the Lord, he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies his own Righteouſneſs, Denies himſelf in Spiritual things. And ye know how it was with the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in the 6. chapter, and the 5. verſe. <hi>Then ſaid I, Wo is me, for I am undone: becauſe I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwel in the midſt of a people of unclean lips.</hi> Wo is me, I am undone, a man of unclean lips. But ſtay, O thou bleſſed Prophet, thou art a great, and haſt been a great Preacher, a Goſpel Preacher: yea, thou art a Prophet. Well (ſaies he) yet, Wo is me, for I am undone, I am a man of unclean lips. Why? what's the matter? (At the latter end of the verſe) <hi>for mine eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of hoſts.</hi> And if ye look into the former verſes of that chapter, ye ſhall find, That it was a ſight of Chriſt in his glory, as will more fully appear, by comparing of that, and the 4. chapter of the <hi>Revelation</hi> together at your leiſure. But where can a man ſee the Glory of God, but in the Goſpel? The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is called, The Glorious Goſpel: there the Glory of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:162406:44"/>God is to be ſeen. With open face there, as in a glaſs, we behold the Glory of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, The more I ſee Chriſt as an Eminent, Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent Example of Humility, and Self-Denial; the more I learn to Deny my ſelf, even in Spiritual things. Now the Goſpel holds forth Chriſt as the moſt Eminent Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Humility, and Self-Denial: ſuch an Example as the Sun never ſaw before,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>Luke,</hi> 22.42.</note> from firſt to laſt. At the firſt; <hi>He thought it no robbery</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>to be equal with God: and yet he humbled himſelf, and took upon him the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi> And at the laſt: Saies he unto his father, <hi>Yet not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> And if ye look into the 13. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>John,</hi> ye ſhall find there, that our Lord and Savior Jeſus Chriſt, takes a towel, and water, and fals down at the feet of his Diſciples, and waſhes their feet, verſe the 4. <hi>He riſeth from ſupper, and laid aſide his garments, and took a towel, and girded himſelf: and after he had powred water into a beſin, he began to waſh his Diſciples feet, and to wipe them with a towel. When the Phariſee ſaw the woman come unto Chriſt, and waſh his feet, and wipe them with the hair of her head; he wondred, and ſaid, Surely, if this had been a Prophet, he would not have ſuffered a ſinner to come ſo neer to him.</hi> Did the Phariſee wonder at this condeſcention, That Chriſt ſhould humble himſelf ſo far, as to ſuffer a poor woman to come ſo neer him, as to waſh his feet with her tears? Oh! what condeſcention is here! for ever to be wondred at, That the Lord Chriſt himſelf, ſhould down upon his knees, and waſh the Diſciples feet: that the great God of heaven and earth, the ſecond perſon incarnate, ſhould now come, fall down at the feet of ſinners. (<hi>Judas</hi> among them too) and waſh his Diſciples feet; When all power in heaven and earth was in his hands, that with thoſe hands he ſhould waſh the feet of ſinners!</p>
               <p>But ſtay a little, It may be all power in heaven and earth was not then given into his hands. Yes, reade for that purpoſe, the 3. verſe (that goes before this ſtory) <hi>Jeſus kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:162406:44"/>that he was come from God, and went to God; he riſeth from ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and laid aſide his garments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though all power in heaven and earth, was given into his hands; it may be he did not know it. Yes, (ſaies the text) <hi>Jeſus knowing that the Father had given all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God: He riſeth from ſupper, and laid aſide his garments, and took a towel, and girded himſelf: After that, he powred water into a baſin, and began to waſh the Diſciples feet.</hi> Oh! what Self-Denial is here! was there ever ſuch Self-denial as here? And this, this does the Goſpel hold forth unto ye, and only to be learned in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly. The more I ſee my ſelf a debter unto Jeſus Chriſt, for all my Gifts, and for all my Graces; the more Humble I ſhall be, and the more I ſhall deny my ſelf in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things. Ye know how it is with a man that ows for his Cloaths: Poſſibly, a man may wear brave, and fine Cloaths; but he ows for them at ſuch a ſhop. While he is abroad, he ſwaggers, and is proud of his Cloaths: but when he comes into the ſhop where he ows for them, and looks upon the book, and what he hath to pay, he ſtrikes ſail then, and is more modeſt, aſhamed, and bluſhes. The Goſpel is the great Shop, from whence we have al our gifts, and al our graces; and when I come into the Goſpel, there I ſee how infinitly I am a debter to Free-grace for al I have: and though I may be proud in ſpirit at another time, yet if I come into the Goſpel, and ſee what an infinite debter to Free-grace I am, for all that ever I wear upon the back of my ſoul; then I think, Oh! what cauſe have I to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! Shall I be proud? ſhall not I deny my ſelf in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things? I ſay, this Goſpel is the Shop of all our Gifts, and all our Graces.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly. True ſaving, juſtifying faith, is an Empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace; it brings Chriſt into the ſoul: and when Chriſt comes into the ſoul, all other things muſt out. As when a King, or Prince comes into a Houſe; the Maſter of the houſe goes out of his own lodging, and all muſt out, to make
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:162406:45"/>room for the Prince: So when Chriſt comes into ones ſoul, then all goes out, all other things go out. 'Tis in our beleeving on Jeſus Chriſt, as in our beleeving on God the Father.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1</note> 
                  <hi>Ye beleeve in God</hi> (ſaies Chriſt) <hi>beleeve alſo in me.</hi> Look how ye beleeve in God the Father, ſo do ye beleeve in me. Now, as when a man does beleeve in God the Father for Proviſion, for outward Proviſion; as ſeeing an Al-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie in God to Provide; then he ſees an In-ſufficiencie in all the creatures to help, and never before. So, when a man comes to beleeve in Chriſt, when he ſees that Al-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency that is in Chriſt to Redeem, and ſatisfie for him; then he ſees an In-ſufficiency in all his own Duties, and Righteouſneſs, and never till then. The truth is, A man cannot come to Chriſt, unleſs he do forſake all. As, ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to this ſide of the water, or river, unleſſe you come from that ſide of the river. Now faith, it is nothing elſe but a Coming to Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore, where ever there is true, ſaving, juſtifying faith, a man does Deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Spiritual things: he cannot write an I upon his own Performance, upon his own Duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Applyca. </seg>
                  </label> If ſo, if al theſe things be true: How hard a thing is it, for a man to Beleeve! how few are there in the world that do Beleeve indeed! True, ſaving, juſtifying faith, it makes a man Abundant in the work of the Lord; it makes a man live a ſpiritual life: but then it takes away that I from him, he cannot write an I upon what he does, as formerly he hath done. It makes a man live a Spiritual life: but it makes him alſo, to Deny that Spiritual life.</p>
               <p>There are Four ſtreams, that this Spiritual life is divided into: The ſtream of Performance: The ſtream of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: The ſtream of our Sufferings: The ſtream of Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. True ſaving faith, and the Goſpel, makes a man to Deny himſelf in all theſe.</p>
               <p>As for our Performance, and Obedience; ye know what the Apoſtle ſaies concerning himſelf, Thus and thus I was, and thus and thus I have lived: but now I count all things as dung, and droſſe in regard of Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:162406:45"/>
               <p>As for our Sufferings: I have read of ſome Martyrs in the Primitive times; that being in priſon, and ready to ſuffer; divers came to comfort them, and called them, Bleſſed Martyrs. No, (ſay they) we are not worthy of the Name of Martyrs: by no means, they would not bear it, that they ſhould call them Martyrs: Denied themſelves in their Sufferings.</p>
               <p>As for our Enjoyment: Ye know what the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all.</hi>

But where is this Self-Denying frame of heart now to be found amongſt us: How does this I? this ſame Self, creep into all our Speeches, and into all our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Are there not ſome here, that cannot deny themſelves in Outward things? Some here, that cannot Deny themſelves in their Appetite, their Eating, and their Drinking for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? Some here, that cannot Deny themſelves of their wicked Company? Some here, that cannot Deny themſelves of a Frothy, Vain, Jeſt, or Jeer at the people of God for Chriſts ſake?

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Again. Are there not ſome here, that do Seek themſelves in Spiritual things? Self-Seeking, and Self-Advancing (as I have ſaid) do differ, but the one is a ſign of the other. A man can never Deny himſelf, that Seeks himſelf. I ſay, He cannot Deny himſelf in Spiritual things, that Seeks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Spiritual things. Now I pray conſider it: When ye meet with any Spiritual loſſe, Whoſe Accompt and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:162406:46"/>Head do ye ſet it down upon? Ye know how it is in Trade, and Merchandizing: Some men trade for themſelves; and ſome trade for others: If I trade for my Self; when I meet with a loſſe, I ſet it down upon mine own Accompt, and upon mine own Head. If I trade for Another; when I meet with a loſſe, I ſet it down upon his Accompt, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Head. Now when you meet with ſpiritual loſſes; whoſe Accompt do you ſet down your ſpiritual loſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? upon whoſe Head? Are there not many here, that ſet down their ſpiritual loſſes upon their own Accompt? Indeed, I have loſt ſuch an Opportunity, and I have ſinned ſo, and therefore ſhame will come unto me, vexation and trouble. What a diſhonor is this unto Jeſus Chriſt! Some indeed, when they meet with a Spiritual loſſe, they ſet it down upon Chriſts Accompt; and they break their hearts with the Sence of this. Others, they ſet down all their ſpiritual loſſes upon their own heads, and their own Accompts; what does this argue, but that they trade for themſelves, and not for Chriſt: they Seek themſelves, and therefore they don't Deny themſelves.</p>

Now I dare boldly ſay unto thee from the Lord, Thou haſt not yet learned this leſſon of Self-Denyal in ſpiritual things, that wert never Humbled for thy Pride in ſpiritual things. I repeat it again, I ſay, If thou wert never humbled for thy Pride in ſpiritual things to this day, the Lord knows, thou haſt not learned this great leſſon of Self-Denial in ſpiritual things. I ſay no more by way of Convincement; Only this: There is nothing that a Profeſſor is more apt to be proud of, than ſpiritual things. Before a man takes up a Profeſſion; poſſibly then he is proud of his Cloaths; or he is proud of his Friends; or he is proud of his fine Houſe and the like. But after once a man comes to take up a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, there is nothing that he is more apt to be proud of than his Gifts, Graces, and Spiritual things. For, look where a mans Excellency lies, there his Pride grows. Now the Excellency of a Profeſſor lies in ſpiritual things; and therefore there his Pride grows, and there he is moſt apt to be proud. Yet let me tell ye, It is a more dangerous thing to be proud of a mans Duties, and Spiritual Gifts; then to be proud of Cloaths, then to be proud of theſe outward things; For this pride of Spiritual Gifts, it's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to a mans Juſtification. And the more ſecret &amp; hidden any ſin is, the more dangerous it is: and when ſin &amp; Pride lies under Duties, and Spiritual things, then it is hidden indeed. The more Bold a ſin is, the greater it is; When a ſin ſhall dare to come into the preſence of God, then it is bold indeed: Now pride in ſpiritual things comes
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:162406:47"/>more into the preſence of God, than pride of Cloaths and theſe Outward things do, &amp; therfore it is the bolder, and the greater ſin; &amp; therfore, who would not take heed hereof! who would not labor for this Self-Denial? to be humble, and denying of ones ſelf in ſpiritual things? Truly, the firſt ſtep to Humility, is, to ſee ones Pride: and the firſt ſtep to Self-Denial, is to be convinced of ones Self-Advancing.</p>

But where is their Commiſſion? where hath any Miniſter ſuch a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion from the Lord, to put poor people upon ſuch a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:162406:48"/>tryal as this is; Soul! art thou contented to go to Hell if God would have it ſo? Let any Miniſter ſhew me his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to put a ſoul upon ſuch a tryal as this is. And where Soul! haſt thou a Commiſſion to put thy ſelf upon ſuch a tryal? No, we may have an eye to the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; the Lord Chriſt himſelf had ſo, he had an eye him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto the recompence of reward: and therfore, though thou canſt not bring thy ſoul unto this height, yet there may be ſome Humility, even Goſpel Self-denial, that may lie under the leaf. This Goſpel Humility, and Self-denial, it is (as I may ſo ſpeak) the ſouls Violet: The Violet (ye know) it is a very ſweet flower; but it lies very low, it hangs down its head, and it lies under other herbs, obſcure herbs; as if it loved to be unſeen; but it ſmels very ſweetly: and if you would find out this ſweet-ſmelling herb, and violet, you muſt lift up other obſcure leaves, and there you ſhall ſee it. So, this Humility, and Self-denial, it lies under o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Duties, and under other Exerciſes; and if you would ſee it, you muſt lift up other leaves: though thou beeſt not able to attain to that height as to ſay, Thou wouldſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to go to Hel if God would have it ſo: yet thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have this ſweet Violet; though it lie under other herbs, yet thou maieſt ſee it, and it may be ſmelt. Only this: If at any time Self breaks out; if at any time thy ſoul begins to be advanced in regard of Duty, or Spiritual things; I do here call upon you, fall down before the Lord, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy ſelf before him for the pride of thy heart concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spiritual things, and labour to get this Self-denial in ſpiritual things. I am not to ſpeak of Self-Denial at large; but I cal upon you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord, to labor to get Self-denial in <hi>ſpiritual things.</hi> And take theſe Two of Three Motives to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt. The more you deny your ſelf in Spiritual things, the more you ſhall be ſure to keep them. Saies <hi>Chryſoſtome, The beſt treaſury to keep any good work in, is, forgetfulneſs of that good work.</hi> Ye know, that if a man be to travel; the way to keep himſelf and his money is, not to go to the Market-Croſſe, and there proclaim that he hath ſo much money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:162406:48"/>him, or to carry with him in his journey; the only way for a man to loſe his money, is, to let it be known, and to brag of it abroad. And truly, what is the reaſon, that ſo many in theſe daies of ours, have made ſhipwrack? Some heretofore have been very forward, had great Gifts, great Parts; and now they are rotten, they have loſt all; Why? becauſe they were proud of them, and did not walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly under them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly. The more you do deny your ſelves in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, the more humble you will be in other things: and the more humble you are, the more ſweetly ſhall you live in your own boſom, yea, towards and amongſt others. Some poſſibly complain of a Froward ſpirit: Oh! ſaies one, I am of an Angry diſpoſition: my Husband, my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, my Servants, my Wife, or my Friends, cannot meddle with me, or touch me, but I am ready to break out in diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emper, anger, and frowardneſſe; the Lord knows, I have a very froward and peeviſh heart of mine own. But what is the reaſon? Pride, pride is the cauſe of Froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Ye ſee how it is with a Bladder: let a Bladder be blown full of wind, and though you may take it at the end, yet notwithſtanding, you cannot hold the Bladder in your hand, or the greateſt hand in the town cannot hold the Bladder. But take a pin, and prick the bladder, and the leaſt child may hold it then. What is the reaſon that men cannot be held, cannot be handled, cannot be touch'd by their neighbors, friends, and thoſe that are about them; they cannot be graſp'd, and walk'd with? but becauſe they are proud, and ſwoln. Therefore, get an humble, and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying heart, and thou ſhalt walk more ſweetly with thy own ſoul, and others that are about thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly. The more you deny your ſelves in Spiritual things, the more you ſhall be exalted in them. I ſay, The more you deny your ſelves in Spiritual things, the more thoſe ſpiritual things ſhal grow, be exalted, the more increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. <hi>Humble thy ſelf,</hi>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:162406:49"/>me tell you this: that look what that is wherein you do Humble your ſelves before the Lord, therein the Lord will exalt you. Doeſt thou humble thy ſelf before the Lord in regard of theſe outward things? There will the Lord Exalt thee. Doeſt thou humble thy ſelf before the Lord in regard of thy Parts, and thy Gifts? There will the Lord exalt thee. Doeſt thou humble thy ſelf before the Lord in regard of thine own Graces? and thine own Obedience? and thine own Righteouſneſs? Therein will the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt thee. Ye know that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ſaid concerning Chriſt,<note place="margin">

When your heart is Dead, when your heart is Hard, when you ſay, God is now gone, and will never return again: Oh! what free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom once I had in Prayer! but now my heart is hard, and I ſhall never be able to Pray again: Then comes the Spirit of God, and breathes upon your ſoul, and gives you Prayer again. Now if I would but obſerve the breathings of the Spirit of the Lord, how it comes upon me thus, when I am dead, when my heart is hard, when I ſay I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have prayer again; if I could but obſerve the Freeneſs of the Spirits breathing over my ſoul, and raiſing up my heart to Duty again; ſhould I be proud of Duty, think you? ſhould I not rather ſay, Shall I be proud?

The more you ſee an Humble Chriſt, the more you will learn Humility: Where ſhall you ſee an humble Chriſt, but in the Goſpel? The more you ſee a Self-denying Chriſt, the more you will learn Self-denial: And where ſhall you reade of a Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying

The more Faith ye have, the more you will deny your ſelves in Spiritual things: And where ſhall ye get faith, but in the preaching of the Goſpel, and in ſtudying of the Goſpel? This grace of Humility and Self-denyal in ſpiritual things, grows only in the garden of the Goſpel, in the bed of the Goſpel. There is a Field-Humility; and there is a Common, or a Field-Self-Denial, as I may ſo ſpeak. As ye ſee it is with your Flowers, and Herbs: There is a garden-Tyme; and there is a Field-Tyme; there is a Garden-Roſe; and there is a Field-Roſe: there is a Garden-Hony-ſuckle; and there is a Field-Hony-ſuckle: So there is a Field-Self-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, that grows among Heathen, and among Moral peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that can deny themſelves of this or that particular thing; their Appetite, Cloathing, or now and then their Company.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:162406:51"/>is like unto God; his Attributes are all infinite, He is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in Wiſdom, Juſtice, Power, and Mercy: and ſo, he is infinite in his Eſſence, and therefore Eſſentially preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the World.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly. God is ſaid to be in the World, and the things of the World, <hi>By way of ſpecial manifeſtation.</hi> And ſo God was in the Temple, not becauſe his Eſſence was more in the Temple than in another place; but he was in the Temple by way of Manifeſtation of Himſelf unto his People there. And thus alſo, Jeſus Chriſt is in the hearts of thoſe that are beleevers, ſpecially manifeſting, and revealing himſelf there unto them. But yet this is not all neither.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly. God is ſaid to be in a Creature, <hi>By way of Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> being Perſonally United to him. As when the Deity by the ſecond Perſon, was united unto our Nature, unto fleſh: God was in Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9.</note> 
                  <hi>in whom the fulneſs of the Deity dwells bodily,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle. And thus, in a Spiritual, and Myſtical way and manner, Chriſt is in all Beleevers by his Spirit, the third Perſon: not only the <hi>Graces</hi> of Chriſt, but Chriſt <hi>Himſelf,</hi> in and by Spirit, is in the heart of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever; I ſay, Chriſt by his Spirit. And therefore <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> obſerves, Whereas it is ſaid, in the 8. of the Romans, and the 9. verſe, That, <hi>if the Spirit of God dwell in ye:</hi> at the 10. verſe following, it is ſaid, <hi>If Chriſt be in you,</hi> Thoſe two being made one, one being put for the other. Now I ſay, That Chriſt that is in a Beleever, is not the Habit of grace only, which the Saints have in their ſouls, but Chriſt Himſelf by his Spirit. And therefore if ye look into that 5. chapter to the Romans, ye ſhall find, That beſides the <hi>Grace</hi> of the Spirit, the Spirit <hi>it Self</hi> is ſaid to be given unto us. verſe the 5. <hi>Becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts, by the holy Ghoſt which is given unto us.</hi> Not only the <hi>Grace</hi> of the holy Ghoſt given unto us, and ſhed abroad in our hearts: but the Spirit <hi>it Self</hi> which is given unto us. And ſo in that 16. chapter of <hi>John,</hi> where the Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to ſend the Comforter. <hi>He ſhall teach ye</hi> (ſaies Chriſt)
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:162406:52"/>
                  <hi>and he ſhall teach ye all things; and he will ſhew unto ye things to come,</hi> verſe the 13. But the Habits of grace cannot teach a man, and ſhew him things to come. And what ſhall he teach? verſe the 13. <hi>Whatſoever he ſhall hear, that he ſhall ſpeak.</hi> This is the Comforter, this is the Spirit. Now the Habits of grace does not thus ſpeak, and hear, and therefore certainly, the Spirit of Chriſt is in the hearts of Gods people, and in the hearts of Beleevers; it's more than the bare Habit of grace, the gifts and the graces of the Spirit. And to this purpoſe it's clearly ſpoken by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, in the 8. chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the 11. verſe, <hi>But if the Spirit of Him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, dwell in you: He that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies, by His Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> This ſpirit cannot be meant Habitual grace. But if the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, dwell in you. So that plainly then, in a Spiritual, and Miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal way, Chriſt is in each Beleever by his Spirit: and this Chriſt in a Beleever, is not the <hi>Gifts</hi> and the <hi>Graces</hi> of the Spirit, but Chriſt <hi>Himſelf</hi> by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>This I confeſſe riſes high; but herein I am not alone: divers <hi>School-men,</hi> and <hi>Fathers;</hi> and of our own <hi>Divines</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with me. The Reverend Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> it was his ſpeech, That the Perſon of a Beleever, is united to the Perſon of Chriſt. But I ſhall give you the words of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Preacher, that is now in Heaven, as we have them in the Works that he hath left. Saies he, It hath been a great Diſpute among the School-men, Whether a Beleever does receive the holy Ghoſt it <hi>Self,</hi> or only the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> of the holy Ghoſt: But (ſaies he) it is a Queſtion, where there needs be no Queſtion; and Diſpute, where there needs no Diſpute: for the Scripture is clear, That we do not only receive the <hi>Gifts</hi> and the <hi>Graces</hi> of the holy Ghoſt, but the holy Ghoſt it <hi>Self,</hi> for are we not ſaid to be, <hi>the Temple of the holy Ghoſt?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19.</note> and this ſets out the abundant Kindneſs, and Goodneſs of God: As (ſaies he yet) it is more Kindneſs to give a man Fruit and the Tree, than to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:162406:52"/>give him barely the Fruit: So it is abundantly more grace in God, to give a man the holy Ghoſt it <hi>Self,</hi> rather than to give him only the <hi>Gifts</hi> and the <hi>Graces</hi> of the holy Ghoſt. And indeed, What greater Comfort can there be than this? That Beleevers are not only made partakers of the Gifts and Graces of the holy Ghoſt, but of Chriſt Himſelf, Chriſt really in all Beleevers, by his Spirit?</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt of all, You muſt-know, That though Chriſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally united unto each Beleever, yet this Unition, or Union is a <hi>Voluntary</hi> act, and not a <hi>Natural</hi> act, and ſo Chriſt may Unite himſelf unto the ſoul, ſo far as it pleaſes himſelf: It is not a Natural act, but a Voluntary act; and being an act wherein he is free, he may Unite himſelf unto the ſoul, ſo far as he pleaſes, and no farther. Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath not united himſelf ſo far unto the ſoul of a Beleever, that a Beleever ſhould ſay, I am Chriſt, and I am the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: for, then a Beleever were to be Worſhipped as well as Chriſt, if he were Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly. You muſt know this, That there is a great-deal of difference, between joyning unto another, by way of <hi>Contact,</hi> or <hi>Touching;</hi> and joyning unto another, by way of <hi>Compoſition.</hi> As for Example, The Sea and the Land, they are joyned together, they are united: but how? not by way of Compoſition, but by way of Contact; the Sea touches the Land, &amp; the Land touches the Sea: yet the Land cannot ſay, I am the Sea; nor the Sea cannot ſay, I am the Land: Why? becauſe it is an Union only by Contact, by Touching, and not by Compoſition, one being compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the other. So the Union that is between Chriſt and a Beleever, it is by way of Spiritual Contact; Chriſt tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſoul by his Spirit; and the ſoul touching Chriſt by faith. I ſay, it is a Union by way of Spiritual Contact, and Touching; and not by Compoſition; and therefore a Beleever cannot ſay, that I am Chriſt, and I am the Spirit.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:162406:53"/>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly. You muſt know, There is a Two-fold In-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. One whereby Eſſences are <hi>applyed</hi> unto each other; and another, whereby Eſſences are <hi>mixt</hi> together. I'le make it as plain as I can, thus: Ye ſee in a heap of Stone, and Wheat, they both make but one heap: and the Stone may ſay, I am in this heap, and the Wheat may ſay, I am in this heap; but the Stone cannot ſay, I am the Wheat; nor the Wheat cannot ſay I am the Stone: Why? becauſe though they be united, and joyned together in one heap, it is by way of Application of one Eſſence unto another, one being applied unto another. But now, take Water and Wine, and mingle them together, and there every part may ſay, I am Water, and I am Wine: Why? becauſe there is an Union by way of Mixture. Now there is a great Union between Chriſt and a Beleeving ſoul: yet a beleeving ſoul though he be really united to Chriſt by the Spirit, cannot ſay, I am Chriſt, or I am the Spirit: Why? becauſe it is an Union by way of Application, and not by way of Mixture, as Wine and Water mingled together: if it were an Union by way of Eſſences, then a beleever might ſay, I am Chriſt, and I am the Spirit: but it is an Union by way of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a beleever being applied to Chriſt, and Chriſt appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto a beleever.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly. You muſt know this, That there is a great-deal of difference between the In-being of a Spiritual thing in a Material; and the In-being of one Material, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porial thing in another. I ſhall make it as plain as I can, and it will be of concernment to you. Take a body now, and let that be mixt with another, and each part may ſay, I am that which I am joyned to: but take the Spirit, or a Spiritual Being, and let that be mixt with a more Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Being; and then the Material Being cannot ſay, I am the Spirit; and the Spirit, I am the Matter. As now ye ſee in the great Union between the <hi>Soul,</hi> and the <hi>Body:</hi> the Soul is in every part of a man, <hi>tota in toto;</hi> the Soul (ſaies the Philoſopher) is wholly in every part; the whole ſoul of man being in every part of the body: yet notwithſtanding,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:162406:54"/>the Body cannot ſay, I am the Soul, nor the Soul cannot ſay, I am the Body, becauſe they are thus united together. Why? becauſe here is an Union of a Spiritual thing with a more Material, which does keep the Natures diſtinct. Or thus, give me leave to expreſſe it to ye: Iron and Fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned together, your Fire is in every part of the Iron; and yet notwithſtanding, though the Fire be in every part of the Iron, the Iron cannot ſay, I am the Fire; nor the Fire cannot ſay, I am the Iron: Why? becauſe here is a more Spiritual Body, in a more Material Body, and ſo the Natures are kept diſtinct. Or if you will, yet farther: Ye ſee the Light in the Air; the Light is more Spiritual than the Air, and the Light is in every part of the Air; yet notwithſtanding, the Air cannot ſay, I am the Light, nor the Light cannot ſay, I am the Air; but theſe two are kept diſtinct: Why? becauſe here is an Union of that which is more Spiritual, unto that which is more Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. So I ſay here, Though Chriſt be really United unto each Beleever; yet notwithſtanding, the ſoul of a Belever is more Material; though not in it ſelf Material, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Chriſt, the ſoul is a groſſe Nature in regard of the Spirit of Chirſt; and being thus (therefore) united, theſe Natures are kept diſtinct; the Spirit of Chriſt is kept di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Nature of the ſoul, and the ſoul from the Nature of the Spirit: and therefore, the ſoul of a Beleever, though united really unto Chriſt by the Spirit, cannot ſay, I am the Spirit, or I am Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>But if we look (will ſome ſay) into the</hi> 17. <hi>chapter of</hi> John, <hi>our Lord and Saviour Chriſt ſeems to ſpeak this way</hi> (<hi>at the</hi> 20, <hi>and</hi> 21. <hi>verſes</hi>) Neither pray I for theſe alone, <hi>(ſaies he)</hi> but for them alſo which ſhall beleeve on me through their word: That they all may be one; as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us. <hi>Here Chriſt prayes, That Beleevers may be one with him, as he and the Father were one: but if Chriſt be really united to each Beleever by his Spirit; What difference is there between this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion: the ſecond Perſon was united unto our Nature, to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:162406:54"/>our Fleſh; and if now Chriſt be united unto a Beleever by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is the Third Perſon; What is the difference between the Hypoſtatical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of a Beleever with Chriſt by the Spirit?</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> Much every way. For take a Beleever, and though Chriſt be United unto a Beleever really by his Spirit; yet notwithſtanding, the Beleever is not ſaid to be Aſſumed, the Spirit doth not Aſſume the heart of a Beleever, as the ſecond Perſon did Aſſume our fleſh; and though we are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited unto Chriſt by the ſpirit, yet not ſaid to be Aſſumed by the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Again, Though Chriſt be really united unto each Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet it is no Perſonal Union, as the Hypoſtatical Union is. A man is a Perſon before he is United ſo unto Chriſt by the ſpirit: but now Chriſts Soul and Body, they were not a Perſon before United unto the Second Perſon: but the Soul and Body of Chriſt, and the ſecond Perſon in the Trinitie United together make up one Perſon. I ſay, that is a Perſonal Union, all making up but one Perſon. But now a Beleever, he is a Perſon before his Union with Chriſt by the ſpirit; he is a Perſon, a Wicked Perſon, but he is a Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Again, The Union that is between Chriſt and a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it is in reſpect of the other Union, an Accidental U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Chriſt United unto the ſoul by Faith, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening of Grace and Accidents. But now the ſecond Perſon was United unto our Nature, and unto our Fleſh, not by the intervening of any Grace, or any Accident, but their Subſtance was United unto Subſtance by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon. I ſay, it was not an Union by the interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of any Grace: for though all graces were in Chriſt, yet the union of the ſecond Perſon to our fleſh, is not by the intervening of any Grace, Faith or the like: but now our union to Chriſt is by the intervening of Grace, (of faith) and ſo this union is but an Accidental union in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Again, Though Chriſt be united unto all Beleevers by
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:162406:55"/>his Spirit; yet he is ſo far united unto a beleever, as to make him a member of the Body only: But the ſecond Perſon was United unto our Nature, and unto our fleſh to make Chriſt the Mediator. Indeed, if God were United to man for far as to make him Mediator between God and Man, then he might ſay, I am God, and I am Chriſt: but (I ſay,) this Union being Voluntary, he does ſo far Unite himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoul of a Beleever, as to make him a Member of the Body only, and not a Mediator. But when the Second Perſon was United to our Nature, the Union was to make the Perſon a Mediator. And thus ye ſee, there is a great deal of Difference between that Hypoſtatical Union, and this Myſtical Union of a Beleever.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is ſaid, in that 17. of <hi>John,</hi> That Chriſt praies that we may be one with him, as he is with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee; that they alſo may be one.</hi> I anſwer: This is an <hi>As</hi> of <hi>Similitude,</hi> and not of <hi>Equallity:</hi> Chriſt praies unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Beleevers may be one with him; not by way of Equallitie; that a Beleever ſhould be Equallie one with Chriſt, as Chriſt is with the Father: for then Chriſt ſhould pray, that a Beleever might be worſhipped too, which he never did: and if that Chriſt here ſhould pray, that a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever might be one with Chriſt, as Chriſt with the Father, in regard of Equallitie; then Chriſt ſhould pray, that a Beleever ſhould be one with him from Eternity: for ſaies he unto his Father in the beginning of the chapter, <hi>Glorify me with thy ſelf, with the ſame glory which I had with thee before the world was.</hi> Chriſt was one with the Father before the world was. Therefore, if he ſhould pray, that a Beleever might be one with him, in regard of Equallity, he ſhould pray that a Beleever might be one with him, in that reſpect: which were impoſſible. But he does not pray, that a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever might be one with him, by way of Equallitie, as he is one with the Father by way of Equallitie, but Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude. And yet divers Learned and Reverend men, think the meaning of that place rather to be this, That they may
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:162406:55"/>be one among themſelves: Chriſt prayes, that they may be all one; that is, Lord, I pray, that they may love, and agree together; he prayes for Union among themſelves But ſuppoſe it be taken the other way, That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt here does pray, that Beleevers may be one with him, as he is with the Father: That is, not in regard of Equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, but in regard of Similitude; that as Chriſt is one with the Father in a way ſutable to him, ſo Beleevers may be one with Chriſt in a way ſutable unto them.</p>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:162406:56"/>a mans Sanctification does bear witneſs to him that he is the Child of God, that is, Water. But now, Sanctification conſiſts, either in the Habit of grace, or in the Acting of grace; if therefore the Spirit of Chriſt in a Beleever, were nothing elſe but Grace, inherent Grace, then it were all one with the teſtimony of Water: but there are Three that bear witneſſe, There's the teſtimony of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, there's the teſtimonie of Blood, and there's the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Water: If by the Spirit we are to underſtand only, the Grace of Chriſt, the Habit of grace in the ſoul, then there would be but Two that bear witneſſe, namely, Water, and Blood; becauſe the other would be al one with Water; Water being meant only Sanctification: But now there are Three that do bear witneſſe unto a ſoul that is in Chriſt, The Spirit, and Blood, and Water; and therefore Chriſt is really in a Beleever, Chriſt really united unto all Beleevers by his Spirit.</p>

For Union is the root of Communion: The Husband &amp; the Wife are firſt Joyned together, and United, and then they have Communion with one another, and Fellowſhip in their goods, and eſtate; Union is the ground of Communion. And the nearer the Union, the greater the Communion. Now if Chriſt ſhould be only in a beleever by the Habit of grace, the Union would not be ſo great: but if this be true, That Chriſt is really in a beleever by his Spirit, Chriſt really United to each beleever; here the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is nearer, and therefore the Communion, and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that a beleever ſhall have with Chriſt, a great deal more and more bleſſed.</p>

But where do ye find in all the Scripture, that the Lord Chriſt is ſaid to be in an Hypocrite?

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:162406:57"/>by his Spirit; Then a beleever ſhal never die again, ſpiritually die again. I have read of a Woman, that when her Husband was dead, ſhe would eat and drink the aſhes of her Husband; have his bodie burnt to aſhes, and ſo eat and drink the aſhes of her husband: and being asked the reaſon; becauſe (ſaies ſhe) I mean to part with him no more: I have parted with him once already, when we were one; but now I will be made one with him in another way, and I will part no more with him. So, if Chriſt be in a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, really in a Beleever, Chriſt really united unto each Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever by his Spirit; Then Chriſt and that Beleever ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver part again, that Beleever ſhal die no more: for the ſame Spirit that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, dwelling in a Beleever, ſhal alſo raiſe up a poor beleever, yea though he fal into the grave of ſin; he ſhal never die ſpiritually again upon this account.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly. If Chriſt be really united unto al beleevers by his Spirit; Then they may come with boldneſs unto the throne of grace, and with unlimitted expectations of mercie from God the Father, and from Chriſt Jeſus. The nearer ye are unto any Perſon, the more boldneſs ye have towards him, and the larger will your expectations be from him. If a man marry his Servant; whilſt ſhe was his maid, ſhe was not ſo bold, nor could expect ſo much from him: when ſhe becomes the Wife, then ſhe is more bold, and can expect more, becauſe now ſhe is nearer: A Child may have more boldnes, and expect more from the Father than the ſervant: and the ſervant that is within doors, more than the ſervant that works in the field; but the Wife that is neareſt, ſhe is moſt bold, comes with moſt boldneſs into the preſence of the man, and hath the largeſt expectations from him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe is neareſt to him. So the nearer that the ſoul of a beleever does get unto God, the more boldneſs he may have when he comes to God, and the largen expectations of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from him. Now if Chriſt were in a beleever only by the Habit of grace, and Chriſt in the ſoul were nothing elſe but the Habit of grace; here were yet a great diſtance from
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:162406:57"/>Chriſt: but now, if Jeſus Chriſt be really United unto each Beleever by his Spirit, here is a cloſe Union indeed. And therefore, upon this account, every beleever may come with boldneſs now, and with Unlimitted expectations of mercy from God the Father, being brought thus neer, that Chriſt Himſelf is really in the beleevers ſoul. And what a Glorious, and Bleſſed Condition is every beleever in now upon this account!</p>

It was infinite love in Chriſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend ſo far, as to come down into our Nature when he was incarnate: but as if he were not neer enough to us then, he comes down into the heart of a beleever by his Spirit. When Chriſt was upon the Earth, we were in him as in a common Perſon: Now Chriſt is in Heaven, he is in us by his Spirit. What Glorious, Condeſcending love is here! If a Father Portion a Child, ſet him up in a good Trade, and the child decay through his own folly, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not Portion him again: poſſibly he may help him, but he will not give him, ordinarily parents do not give ſo great a Portion to help him up again, ſomewhat the parent will do, but not ſo much as at the firſt. The Lord of Heaven, he put a great Portion into our hands at firſt, and we decayed and broke, and behold! the Lord does not only give us as good a Portion as we had at the firſt, but infinitely better: for now the Lord Chriſt is U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited unto each Beleever, now he comes and dwels in the ſoul of a beleever by his Spirit.

What comfort is it then unto a poor ſoul, that Chriſt is alwaies in him, really in him by his Spirit! You that are beleevers, will not this content you? He is too Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous whom God cannot ſuffice. He hath all things, that hath him that hath all things. Now every beleever hath Chriſt, Chriſt really in a beleever by his Spirit; not No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, not by the Habit of grace only, but Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally United unto each beleever by the Spirit.

It was no great matter, for the poor Woman to give one or two mites into the Treaſury: but ſhe having no more, and it being all her livelihood, it was a great matter. It is no great matter, for a man to pray, and to pray conſtantly, and to frequent the Ordinances: but when a poor creature ſhall meet with all oppoſition from his Relations, then it may be a great matter to do this. It is no great matter (comparatively) for to ſtay ones ſoul upon Jeſus Chriſt. But in the time of temptation, when ones ſoul is full of Fears, and a man does look upon Chriſt as his enemy, then to caſt himſelf into the arms of Chriſt, and to ſtay the ſoul upon Chriſt then, this is a greater work. So that the work is great, though ſmall in it ſelf, it is meet with great oppoſition, and break through all.</p>
               <p>But whoſoever you are that make this Objection, fearing that you are not in Chriſt, and ſo have not the comfort of this Doctrine: Give me leave to propound Three or Four Queſtions to you.</p>
               <p>

Ye ſay, ſuch a man, or a Noble man lives here, for his ſervants go in and out daily. And what Words come out of your mouth? and what Words go in at your ear? whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are they ordinarily? are you ever better than when you are thinking, or ſpeaking of Jeſus Chriſt? &amp; hearing from Chriſt? Certainly, if his ſervants do moſt ordinarily come in and go out, the Maſter is within, Chriſt is within.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Do not ye find your ſouls in ſome meaſure Naturallized unto the Work of Chriſt? the Things of Chriſt, and the Work of Chriſt in ſome meaſure Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized unto your ſouls? <hi>Adam</hi> (ye know) was the firſt man,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:162406:59"/>the father of us all; we were in Him as your Root, and he in Us as his Seed: and his Works, they are Naturallized to us. We being in him as in the Root, and he being in us as in his Seed, his Works are Naturallized to us. It's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to See, and to Hear, and to Speak; it's natural for a man to Sin. Sometimes ye have a Wicked man hating of a Godly, Gracious man, and he can give you no reaſon for it; I cannot tell why (ſaith he) but my heart is againſt him. But I'le tell ye why, and what the reaſon is: The Old Man is in him, the Old <hi>Adam</hi> is in him, and the work of <hi>Adam</hi> is Naturallized to a Wicked man, and he can give you no reaſon, (many times) why he does ſo, becauſe the Work is Naturallized to him. So on the contrary, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is our ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and beleevers being in him as in their Root, and he in them as in his Seed; his Works alſo, are Naturallized unto a beleever in a great meaſure; that a beleever (ſometimes) his heart does ſtand unto the good Work of God, and he can give you no reaſon for it: why I ſhould love this or that Godly man, I can give you no reaſon; but ſo it is, my heart ſtands towards him. The reaſon is this, becauſe that Chriſt the Second <hi>Adam</hi> is within, and ſo his Work, and Things are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized unto the ſoul; and in ſome meaſure, is it not ſo with you?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Whoever you are that make this Objection: Did ye ever find, perceive, or think, that Chriſt is in you? It may be now ye are under ſome preſent Fear, Doubting: but were you never perſwaded of this In-being? did ye never think, or were ye never perſwaded that Chriſt was in you? Yes, ſometimes I have, and ſometimes I have not again: Sometimes I do think that Chriſt is in me of a truth, and ſometimes I do not. Then, look into the 14. chapter of <hi>John,</hi> ye ſhall ſee what our Savior promiſes. <hi>I will pray the Father</hi> (at the 16. verſe) <hi>and he ſhall give you another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</hi> And what then?

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:162406:59"/>day. It may be for the preſent you cannot ſay, that Chriſt is in you, you in him, and he in you: but did ye never think yet in all your life that Chriſt was in you? Yes, once or twice, or ſometimes, I confeſs I did think that Chriſt was in me, and I was ſtrongly perſwaded too, that Chriſt was in me; but now I have loſt thoſe perſwaſions. But how came ye to be ſo perſwaded at that time that Chriſt was in you? Thus it was with me, My heart was Dead, Hard, and I could not pray; I thought that God and Mercy was gone, that I ſhould never ſee the face of God again; and all on a ſudden, when my ſoul was in this ſad condition, I know not how, but all on a ſudden, a ſtrange and unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable comfort came upon my ſoul, and my ſoul ſtood up, as it were, from the dead, and then I had that perſwaſion, that Chriſt was in me. Well, ſoul! be of good comfort, this was Chriſts time, that was Chriſts time; and though now for the preſent, thou canſt not ſay, that Chriſt is in thee; I tell thee from the Lord, that time ſhall come again, and Chriſt will ſend the Comforter again, and then ſhalt thou know, that thou art in the Father, and Chriſt is in thee, and thou art in Jeſus Chriſt: for what he ſaid unto thoſe Diſciples, he ſaid unto other of the Diſciples, Wait but a little, and thoug I be abſent for a little time, I will ſend the Comforter, and then ſhall you know: although you do not know now, yet there is a time, when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter ſhall come, and then ſhalt thou know, that Chriſt is in thee, and thou art in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly. Although for the preſent, you do not find thoſe workings of Chriſt in you, and thoſe powerful ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Spirit, which ſhould argue this ſame In be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Yet do ye not find ſome workings of grace in your ſoul, according unto that Place, Room, and Station that you have in the Body of Chriſt? The ſoul, ye know, is in the body, yet the ſoul does not put forth ſuch power in one Member, as it puts forth in another; the ſoul does not act in one Member, as it does in another; it does not put forth ſo much ſtrength in the little Finger, or in the Thumb, as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:162406:60"/>it puts forth in the Arm: The ſoul does not act in the Eye, as it acts in the Mouth; neither does it act in the Tongue, as it acts in the Ear: Should the Eye ſay, I have no ſoul in me, becauſe I cannot ſpeak like the Tongue? Should the Tongue ſay, I have no ſoul in me, becauſe I cannot ſee like the Eye? Should the Ear ſay, I have no ſoul in me, becauſe I cannot ſpeak like the Tongue? No; but the ſoul that is in the body, it gives according to the Station, and Place of every member that is in the body. So now, the Lord Chriſt he gives out unto all his Body: he is by his Spirit in the hearts of Beleevers; but he does not give unto every Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver alike: One Beleever hath one place in the Body of Chriſt, and another beleever hath another place in the Body of Chriſt. But now I ſay to thee, Obſerve what Place, Room, and Station thou haſt in the Body of Chriſt, and then tell me whether I, or no, do not ye find ſome workings of grace, in ſome meaſure, ſutable unto the Place, Room, and Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ye have in the Body of Chriſt? Yes, ſurely, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny this, but there are ſome workings in my ſoul, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Room, and Station that I have in the Body of Chriſt: And this I can ſay, That when the Comforter came, then I did know, that Chriſt was in me: And I can ſay this alſo (through grace) in ſome meaſure, The Work, and Things of Chriſt are Naturalized to me: They are the Servants, and Retinue of Chriſt, that do come in, and go out unto my ſoul: The Lord knows, I am never better than when I am ſpeaking of Jeſus Chriſt, and hearing from Jeſus Chriſt. If ſo, ſoul! be of good comfort, though thou haſt feared that Chriſt is not in thee, Go in peace, thy faith hath made thee whol;and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is in thy ſoul, the Lord Chriſt that is thus really united unto each Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by his Spirit, is really in thy ſoul, and in thy heart.</p>

I know, a man that is made partaker of this great mercy, this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of Chriſt in the Soul, can never be Thankful in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion unto the mercy received; but he may be thankful in Proportion unto other mercies. You will be thankful to a man that gives you an hundred pound; you will be more thankful to him that gives you a thouſand pound; you will be more thankful to him that gives you a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound a yeer: It may be you will ſay to him that gives you a thouſand pound, I can never be thankful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to you; but yet you will be more thankful to him that gives you a thouſand pound a year. So here, you can never be thankful enough in proportion to the mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but you may be thankful in proportion to other mercies received. If the Lord had given you the whole world for your portion, you would have been thankful: now in that he hath given you his Son, and that Jeſus Chriſt is really united to you by his Spirit, and Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in your ſoul; he hath done more for you, than if he had given you all the whole world. And will ye be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for theſe outward things? and not for this In-being of

And yet, how many are there, that are ſometimes bleſſing God, and ſhewing ſome kind of thankfulneſſe for outward things; but as for this In-being of Chriſt in the ſoul, that they are ſtrangers to, and the Lord knows, they were never thankful for that, ſo much as for outward things. But if Chriſt be in you of a truth; why ſhould you not be contented with your condition what ever it be, yea, Thankful for it, yea, thankful in Proportion?</p>

You ſay, ſometimes, you would do ſuch or ſuch a work for God; but you have no ſtrength to do it. But if Chriſt be in you of a truth, and really united to your ſoul, Then ſurely you ſhall have ſtrength enough, and you may expect large and great things from him.

               <p>To end all be exhorted, to get a ſhare in this great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that I have been ſpeaking of, this In-being of Chriſt in the ſoul. It may be there are ſome, that can ſay, I have none of Chriſt in my ſoul, and may ſpeak truly; ſome that can ſay, I have an unclean heart within me, but I have no Chriſt within me; I have a wanton heart within me, but I have no Chriſt within me yet; I have a proud heart within me, but I have no Chriſt within me yet; I have a Worldly heart within me, but I have no Chriſt within me yet; I have a Blaſpheming heart within me, but I have no Chriſt within me; I have a Lying and Deceitful heart within me, but I have no Chriſt within me to this day; Lord, I have no Chriſt within me, what ſhall I do? O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it may be, that have indeed Chriſt within them, and they can ſay, Lord, I hope that I have Chriſt within me;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:162406:61"/>but I do not find that I have room enough in my heart for ſuch agueſt: Lord, my ſoul is not enlarged enough for ſuch agueſt as Chriſt is: Lord, my ſoul is a poor narrow room Oh! that my ſoul were more enlarged: what ſhall I do to get my ſoul enlarged to give entertainment to ſuch a gueſt as Chriſt is?</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſpeak to ye both from one Scripture, turn ye both to the 17. of <hi>John,</hi> &amp; the laſt verſ. Saies our Lord and Savior Chriſt, praying unto his father, <hi>And I have declared unto them thy Name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou haſt loved me, may be in them, &amp; I in them.</hi> Mind the words. Here are theſe Three things obſervable in them.

That the way to procure this love, and this In-being is, To have the Name of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. <hi>And I have declared unto them thy Name, and I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it:</hi> Why? <hi>that the love wherewith thou haſt loved me, may be in them, and I in them.</hi> So then, the way for to get this In-being is, to have the Name of God declared unto poor ſouls. What is this Name, the Name of God the Father that Chriſt declares? It was the Love of God; his Free-grace and Love. Saies Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16</note> 
                  <hi>God ſo loved the world &amp;c.</hi> and ſtil Chriſt preach'd the love of God to poor loſt man. This was the Name of God that is declared. Now then, do any of your ſouls complain, That you want this In-being of Chriſt in you? or that you have not room in your ſouls to entertain ſuch a gueſt? Obſerve where this Name of God is declared, and manifeſted, this Free love of God is manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and declared; and there ſet thy ſoul under the ſpout, under the declaration, under the manifeſtation of the Name of God; and look upon it, as if Chriſt were there preaching and declaring the Name of God to thy ſoul, and there Chriſt ſhall come in unto thee, and there thy poor narro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:162406:62"/>and ſtraitned ſoul ſhal be enlarged, and made more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious for Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I beſeech you then, receive this Word of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation; and let every ſoul go unto Jeſus Chriſt, and ſay to this purpoſe, Lord Jeſus, Thy work is to declare the Name of the Father to poor ſinners, that ſo thou maieſt be in them: now O Lord, I am a poor ſinner, Lord, declare the Name of the Father to me; Lord, declare the Name of the Father to me. I have a ſtraitned heart, I have not room enough for thee in my ſoul; Oh! that it were enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for thee: now therefore declare this Name of thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to me; that ſo the love wherewith thy Father hath loved thee, may be in me, and I in thee alſo. Thus I ſay, go unto Jeſus Chriſt. And ſtudy, ſtudy much this In-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt in your ſouls: you that have it not, labor to get it; and you that have this In-being, labor to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for it, improve it, and get your ſouls more and more enlarged under it.</p>

                  <hi>Chriſt doth ſo live in a Beleever, that he hath a greater hand, and ſtroke, in the Spiritual actions of a Beleever, than a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelf hath: Chriſt lives in a Beleever more than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as to his Spiritual actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the opening, and clearing of this Truth. Firſt, I ſhall labor to ſhew you that Chriſt liveth in each Beleever. Secondly, That he hath a greater hand, and ſtroke, in the actions of his Spiritual life, then a Beleever hath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt. That Chriſt liveth in each Beleever. A man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, where he worketh, and ſtaieth, or abideth. A man doth not live where he lieth; he may come and ſtay for a day or two, and yet not be ſaid to live there: but where a man works, and ſtaies, or abides, there he lives. Now both theſe ye ſhall find Chriſt doth: the firſt in that known place, the 7. of <hi>John,</hi> 38. verſe. <hi>He that beleeveth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water. This ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that beleeve on him, ſhould receive.</hi> Where the Spirit of Chriſt is, there is Chriſt. And this is a promiſe made to all Beleevers, more or leſſe, to be fulfilled unto them; Out of their bellies ſhall flow ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of living water: Which is to be underſtood of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. So that the Spirit of Chriſt ſhall be in them, and be working in them. And as for the other, you know what is ſaid in that, 14. of <hi>John,</hi> and the 23. verſe. Saith our Savior there, <hi>If any man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> It's the ſame word that is uſed before for <hi>Manſions, In my fathers houſe are many Manſions,</hi> verſe 2. We will come and take up our <hi>Manſions</hi> with him. And this was ſo received a Principle in the Apoſtles time, that he
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:162406:63"/>ſaies to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in the 1 Epiſtle, 3. chapter, 16. verſe, <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God; and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</hi> But if you look into the, 8. chapter of the <hi>Romans,</hi> you ſhall ſee all proved together, verſe the 10, 11. <hi>And if Chriſt be in you, the body is dead becauſe of ſin: but the ſpirit is life, becauſe of righteouſneſs. But if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, dwell in you: he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> Here are Three or Four things obſervable. Firſt, That Chriſt <hi>in you,</hi> and the Spirit <hi>in you,</hi> is all one. And therefore, having ſaid in the 10. ver. <hi>If Chriſt be in you:</hi> at the 11. verſe, he ſaies, <hi>If the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, dwell in you.</hi> Again you may obſerve here, That Chriſt in a Beleever, is not Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual grace only, for, ſaith he, <hi>If the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, dwell in you.</hi> It was not Faith, or Habitual grace, that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead; but the Spirit of God himſelf. And, ſaith he, this Spirit <hi>dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in you.</hi> So that, Chriſt in a Beleever, is not only the Habit of grace, but the Spirit of Chriſt. And then Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ye may obſerve this too; That this Spirit, is a living Spirit; and dwelleth, or abideth in a Beleever. For it is ſaid twice here, That the Spirit dwelleth in you. So that plainly then, you ſee from the words, Chriſt dwels in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Beleever, Chriſt dwels in every Chriſtian, he liveth in him.</p>
               <p>And if it were not ſo, How ſhould the abſence of Jeſus Chriſt be recompenced by the coming of the Spirit, or of the Comforter? When our Lord and Saviour Chriſt left the World and his Diſciples, he gave them a gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſending his Spirit;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.7</note> 
                  <hi>And if I go not</hi> (ſaith he) the Spirit or <hi>the Comforter, will not come: but if I go, I will ſend the Comforter, and he ſhall make up your loſſe of me.</hi> Now if that the Spirit of Chriſt ſhould not be in a Beleever, and live in him; how would the coming of the Holy Ghoſt, and of the Spirit, make up the loſſe of the perſonal preſence of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:162406:64"/>
               <p>Beſides, You know that friends love to be neer unto one another; and the neerer they are, the happier they count themſelves; they love not to be aſunder: the ſoul of the lover, liveth where it loveth, rather than where it liveth. Now there is the greateſt friendſhip between Chriſt and a Beleever; and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath a happineſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all friends; that he can make himſelf neerer, and be more One with his friends, than any friend in the world can. And therefore, upon thoſe terms of Love and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Chriſt by his Spirit liveth in all Beleevers.</p>

                  </label> It will be ſaid, <hi>If Chriſt liveth in all Beleevers, really liveth in them by his Spirit, then what need of Ordinances? for Chriſt and the Spirit of Chriſt in me, can live without Ordinances: and if a man have attained once unto the Spirit, Chriſt in him, and Chriſt living in him; and have attained unto the Spirit, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt really living in him; what need of any Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without? or Rules without? for the Spirit will be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient-Rule to lead him into all that is right: what need therefore of any Commandements, Rules, or Ordinances without?</hi>

                  </label> Yes: For we uſe the Ordinances, not only for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in them: but as a teſtimony of our Obedience. If that the enjoyment of God, and Chriſt, were the only reaſon of the Ordinances, then in caſe that a man could without the Ordinances have the enjoyment of God, and Chriſt, he might lay by the Ordinances: but ſeeing that we are for to uſe the Ordinances as an act of our Obedience, although a man can enjoy Chriſt, have the Spirit, and Chriſt living in him; yet notwithſtanding, he is ſtill to bear up the Ordinances, becauſe there he is to expreſſe his Obedience unto God, and Chriſt. And now (give me leave a little to fix here, to take off this ſcruple, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection) if you look into the 27. of <hi>Numbers,</hi> you ſhall find, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> had the Spirit, and not in an ordinary way, but in a more than ordinary way the Lord gave <hi>Joſhua</hi> his Spirit: and yet notwithſtanding, <hi>Joſhua</hi> was to be under Commandements, and under Ordinances: at the 18. verſe. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>take thee</hi> Joſhua <hi>the ſun of</hi> Nun, <hi>a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:162406:64"/>man in whom is the Spirit, and lay thine hand on him, and ſet him before</hi> Eleazer <hi>the Prieſt, and before all the Congregation: and give him a charge in their ſight.</hi> Mark, he was to come under a Command, and under a charge although he had the Spirit. <hi>And he ſhall ſtand before,</hi> Eleazer <hi>the Prieſt, who ſhal ask counſel for him after the judgment of</hi> Urim <hi>before the Lord.</hi> And ſo it was. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>did as the Lord commanded him.</hi> Now <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not ſay, What need I go to <hi>Eleazar,</hi> or to the Prieſt? what need I go and conſult by Urim and Thummim? for I have the Spirit, that is able to leade me into all Truth. No, but he ſubmits unto his Charge, and he waits upon the Lord in this way of the Ordinances, although it is ſaid here, that he had the Spirit. So, had not <hi>David</hi> the Spirit in a great meaſure? and yet, did he not uſe the Ordinances? But look into the new Teſtament, and there you find, that the Apoſtles had the Spirit alſo: Our Lord and Savior Chriſt, he breathed upon them; they waited for the coming of the Spirit; and the holy Ghoſt fell upon them: and yet notwithſtanding, they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Commands; for ſaith our Savior Chriſt to them, <hi>Go,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19</note> 
                  <hi>teach all Nations, Baptizing, and teaching them to do what ever I command you.</hi> So that although they had the Spirit, and the holy Ghoſt, in a greater meaſure than any man (for ought I know) ever had ſince; yet notwithſtanding, they were under Commandements: <hi>Teaching them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to do whatſoever I command you.</hi> And ye know what our Savior ſaies, in that place I mentioned even now,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38, 39.</note> 
                  <hi>He that beleeveth on me, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water, (which he ſpake concerning the Spirit, and the holy Ghoſt, that ſhould be given, for he was not yet glorified.</hi>) A Promiſe made to Beleevers, and the Churches, in the times of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; they had the Spirit by vertue of that Promiſe: and yet notwithſtanding, they were under Ordinances, and did uſe the Ordinances. But that you may ſee how this Objection runs croſſe, both to the old, and to the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; look upon one place more; it is in the 30. chap. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the 20. and 21. verſes, a Promiſe made concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:162406:65"/>the times of the Goſpel. <hi>And though the Lord give you the bread of adverſity and the water of affliction, yet ſhall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes ſhall ſee thy teachers.</hi> Here are Ordinances, here are Teachers. Well now, but where is the Spirit? Verſe the 21. <hi>And thine ears ſhall hear a word behind thee, ſaying, This is the way, walk in it.</hi> Thine ears ſhall hear a word behind thee; Who ſpeaks that word? Look into the 1. chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> &amp; there you ſhall find, it is the Spirit that ſpeaks the word behind one, at the 10. verſe. <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lords day, and heard behind me a great voice.</hi> So that this voice behind, is that of the Spirit: When we do not expect the Spirit, the Spirit cometh and ſpeaketh to us. So that, thus now ye ſee, Teaching, and Ordinances, and the Spirit of Chriſt in us, and living in us, may and do ſtand together.</p>

                  </label> But yet will ſome ſay, <hi>What need of theſe things?

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> No, not juſt ſo: for if you look into that 31. of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> from whence the place is fetched: and the 8. chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> ye ſhall find, that the words run thus: <hi>This is the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> (verſe the 10.) <hi>after thoſe daies, ſaith the Lord: I will put my Lawes into their mind, and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people. And they ſhall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, Saying, Know the Lord: For all ſhall know me from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> Mark how the words run: It is not barely ſaid thus; <hi>They ſhall not teach every man his neighbour, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man his brother;</hi> but that clauſe is added to it, <hi>Saying, Know the Lord:</hi> They ſhall not teach every man his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and every man his brother, Saying, Know the Lord. As if he had ſaid, I will now make a Covenant of grace, and mercy with you; I will write my Laws in your
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:162406:65"/>hearts, and ye ſhall all know me, and though you have been taught heretofore, as ignorant people, that have not known the Lord, yet now, becauſe I will write my Laws in your hearts, and my Law ſhall be there; ye ſhall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, Saying, Know the Lord, as if ye were ignorant, but my Law ſhall be within your hearts, and you ſhall be taught as a knowing people.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly. Ye muſt know, that although the Spirit of Chriſt live in every Chriſtian, and ſo God; Yet the Spirit is the free gift of God, and therefore it acts, and works no further than it pleaſeth God to give it. Now look into the Scripture, and you ſhall find, that the Lord was never pleaſed to give the Spirit for this end, that it ſhould be the only Rule of a mans life; but for this end, that it ſhould be an help to a man to know the Rule, and to keep the Rule. Look into the Word, and you ſhall find, that the Spirit of the Lord was never given, to be the only Rule for a man to live by, but it was given to be an help to underſtand, keep, and fulfil the Rule. And therefore <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> doth well obſerve, It is with Chriſt in us, (ſaith he) as with Chriſt without us. In the times of the old Teſtament, the great Promiſe was of giving Chriſt: in the times of the New Teſtament, the great Promiſe is, the giving of the Spirit. Now therefore, looke as it was with Chriſt when he came into the world, ſo with the Spirit when he cometh into the heart, Chriſt in us. Now when Chriſt came into the World, he came not to deſtroy the Law, but he came to fulfill the Law: So when the Spirit cometh into the heart, the Spirit cometh not to deſtroy the Goſpel, or the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Goſpel; but he comes to fulfil the Goſpel. <hi>Chriſtus impletio legis, Spiritus impletio Evangelii.</hi> Chriſt the fulfilling of the Law, the Spirit the fulfilling of the Goſpel. <hi>Quaecunque ſunt in Legi &amp;c.</hi> Whatſoever things are in the Law, Chriſt fulfilleth: whatſoever things are in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, the Spirit fulfilleth. And as when Chriſt came, he came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:162406:66"/>it;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17.</note> (for he ſaith himſelf, <hi>I came to fulfil the Law</hi>) ſo when the Spirit comes into any ſoul, ſaith the Spirit alſo, I come not to deſtroy the Goſpel, or the Commandements of the Goſpel; but I come into this poor ſoule, to help it to fulfill the Commandements of the Goſpel. Now when I do take away the Commandements, and make the Commandements no Commandements to me, (I mean, the Commandements without) then I deſtroy the Commandements as to me: When I do make the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt, as no Ordinances to me; then I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, as to me: And when I make the Rule without, to be no Rule, as to me, then I deſtroy it, as to me: and when I that am a Beleever ſay thus, I have the Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have no need of any Commandement from without, for the Spirit is Rule enough; here I take away the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, as to me; I take away the Ordinances, as to me; I take away the Rule, as to me, and therfore I deſtroy them. Certainly, Chriſt within us, is not contrary to Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us: Chriſt without us, did not deſtroy the Law; Chriſt within us, doth not deſtroy the Goſpel. Therefore, for any now to throw up Ordinances upon this account, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have the Spirit to lead, and guide them; this is to walk contrary to all the Scriptures, both of the Old, and New Teſtament. Oh! that people would think of this one thing, The Spirit was never given to be the only Rule of a mans life; but it was given to help us to underſtand, and to enable us to keep the Rule. Thus you ſee, Ordinances, and Chriſt living in a Chriſtian, can ſtand together. And ſo you have the Firſt thing cleared, and proved, <hi>Chriſt liveth in all Beleevers.</hi>

Look into the 3. chap. of that Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> ye ſhal find at the 11. ver. it is ſaid of Chriſt, He is all in all. The words are, <hi>But Chriſt is all, and in all.</hi> He is all in all men; ſo it may be read: Or, he is all in all things. Either way it may be read, and it ſignifies both, He is al in al men, and he is all in al things. Take the firſt All, for all men; and ſo he is all in all them. Take the laſt All, for all things; and ſo he is all in al them, in al things.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt. As for our Converſion: Ye know what our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ſaies, <hi>None comes unto the Son, but whom the Father draws:</hi>

                  <hi>and none knows the Father, but he unto whom the Son reveals him.</hi> Convert me (ſaith the turning ſoul) and I ſhall be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As for our Performances, or Duties; Prayer, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is. Look into the 8. Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the 26. verſ. <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities.</hi> But how doth this prove, that the Spirit hath a greater hand and ſtroke in our Prayers than our ſelves have? Mark what follows, For, <hi>we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> As for the matter of our Obedience. You know what
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:162406:67"/>the Apoſtle ſaith, both unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> and unto the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> That <hi>we are led by the Spirit:</hi> Beleevers are led by the Spirit. <hi>Plus eſt agi, quam regi.</hi> He doth not ſay, We are ruled by the Spirit, but he ſaith, a Beleever is led by the Spirit; not ruled, but led. It is more to be led, than to be ruled: for when a man is ruled by another, he acts himſelf, and his own actions are ſeen: but when a man is led, and carried away by another, though he may act himſelf, the others action is more ſeen than his. We (ſaith he) are led by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> As for our grace in Suffering; the deportment, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour of a gracious ſoul in the time of Suffering. See what our Savior Chriſt ſaies for that, in the 10. of <hi>Matthew</hi> the 19. and 20. verſes. <hi>But when they deliver you up, take no thought, how or what you ſhall ſpeak: for it ſhall be given you in that ſame hour what ye ſhall ſpeak. For it is not ye that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father which ſpeaketh in you.</hi> So that he hath a greater ſtroke in the grace, and carriage of a ſoul under his ſufferings, than himſelf hath.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> As for the matter of our Aſſurance.

And if the Spirit and Chriſt in a Beleever, the Spirit of Chriſt, have a greater ſtroke in a mans Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in his Performance, in his Obedience, in the grace of his Suffering, and in his Aſſurance, than himſelf hath; then ſurely, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath a greater hand and ſtroke in the ſpiritual actions of Beleevers, than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have; now that is proved.</p>

But (ſaith the Apoſtle) boaſting is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: Surely therefore, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth ſo live in a Chriſtian, as that he hath a greater hand and ſtroke, in all the actions of his ſpiritual life, than a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, or a Beleever hath himſelf; ſo that he may ſay tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, You muſt know this: That it is with Chriſt in us, living in us, as it was with Chriſt without us, living without us. When the Lord Chriſt came into the world, and lived here on earth, lived without us; he lived a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting life, a life under Temptations, and freedom from thoſe Temptations; Deſertions, and freedom from thoſe Deſertions: his life here on earth was a hidden life, a vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led life; <hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not;</hi>

So when Chriſt comes into the ſoul by his Spirit, when he lives there, he lives a conflicting life: he hath his Temptations there, and his freedom from thoſe Temptations; he hath his Deſertions there, and his freedom from thoſe Deſertions; he liveth a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den life there, a vailed life there, he comes to his own,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:162406:68"/>and many times the ſoul that is his own doth not receive him in a way of comfort, is not able to ſay, Chriſt liveth in me. But who ever you are that make this Objection, or lie under this Fear; give me leave to propound Four or Five Queſtions to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, What is that in you, that doth ordinarily ſway the great actions of your lives? When the Lord Chriſt comes into the ſoul, he comes as a King, preſently aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Throne, and takes hold of the Scepter; intereſts himſelf in all that that doth ſway the ſoul, and ſwaies the actions of the ſoul: now what is it that doth ſway a mans actions? <hi>Finis action is domin us et reginae eſt.</hi> The end ſwaies the action. And look what that is that doth ſway your End, that is it which liveth in you: if Self ſwaieth your End, Self liveth in you; if Chriſt ſway your End, Chriſt liveth in you. Now ſoul! take all the actions of thy life, ſince thou haſt ſet thy face towards heaven, and as for the great turnings of your life, and the great actions, Hath not Chriſt been at the end of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly. Do not you find a ſecret kind of diſpoſition unto all the Commandements of the Goſpel? Where the Spirit is, there Chriſt liveth. When the Lord makes a Covenant of grace, you ſhall obſerve he promiſeth, that he will give his Spirit, and withal, that he will write his Law in our hearts: and when he promiſeth in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, that he will write his Law in our hearts, he doth alſo promiſe for to give his Spirit. As when the Lord gave out the Law at firſt to man-kind, he did write the Moral Law in mans heart; ſo that the Heathen now have the Law written in their hearts, the Moral Law; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are diſpoſed and inclined to Morallity, and Civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: So when the Lord comes and makes a Covenant of grace with the ſoul, then he doth give out his Spirit to the ſoul, and then he doth write his Law, the Law of grace, love, and of the Goſpel in that ſoul, and that ſoul hath a ſecret diſpoſition unto all the Commandements of the Goſpel. Now do ye not find it thus with you? when
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:162406:68"/>ſometimes you are tempted to what is evil, do not ye ſay thus, I cannot do it; Oh! Lord, thou knoweſt I cannot live as I have done, and I cannot want the preſence of God and Chriſt. What means this Cannot? but a Law within, that God hath written in the heart, there is the Spirit, and there is Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly. Do not you find your ſouls ſometimes, carried out to what is good, beyond and contrary to your own diſpoſitions, and natural inclinations? It is written of <hi>Ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> the Emperor, that He was an exceeding, meek, loving, quiet, good natured man; and yet He was one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Perſecutors in the Primitive times, He had his hand in two as bloody actions againſt the Saints, as any Perſecutor in thoſe times: yet a man of a quiet, loving, ſweet nature and diſpoſition. How came this to paſſe? He was acted by Satan, and being thus acted beyond his own diſpoſition, and inclination, it argued that Satan had a greater hand and ſtroke in his action than himſelf had. So, when a man ſhall be carried on to what is good, even contrary to his own nature and diſpoſition: what doth this argue, but that the Lord Chriſt hath a greater hand and ſtroke in that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than himſelf hath.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly. Do not you find, ſometimes, (who ever you are that make this Objection, or lie under this fear, That Chriſt doth not live in you) do not you find, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times your ſoul is carried out to what is good, beyond what you intended? When <hi>Zacheus</hi> went up into the Sycamore-tree, he only went up to ſee the outſide of Chriſt; but he comes down, receives Chriſt into his houſe, there he bids him welcome, and ſaith, <hi>Lord, Behold,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke,</hi> 19.8.</note> 
                  <hi>the half of my goods I give to the poor. Zacheus</hi> never intended this when he went up to ſee Chriſt; What's the reaſon? The Lord Chriſt was upon his ſoul, the Lord Chriſt was at work upon him; and becauſe he was carried out farther in this good work than ever he intended, it thereby doth appear, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt had a greater ſtroke in this ſpiritual action of his than himſelf had. As on the other ſide, A wicked man,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:162406:69"/>ſometimes, he begins to ſin; and ſaith he within himſelf, I will do it but a little, I will not goe very farre, I will never do it again, I will now take my leave of this ſin, it ſhall never be acted by me any more. But he goes farther in it than ever he intended; Why? becauſe the Devil hath a greater ſtroke upon him than himſelf hath. So here, when as a mans ſoul ſhall be carried out unto what is good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what he intended, this argues that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is at work upon his ſoul, and hath a greater hand and ſtroke upon his actions; his ſpiritual actions than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath. Now is it not thus with thee?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly. Who ever thou art (man or woman) that makes this Objection, and lies under this fear, That the Lord Chriſt doth not live in thee. Were you never perſwaded of this, did you never yet think, that Chriſt was in you? did you never yet beleeve, that Chriſt lived in you? Yes, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I had ſuch thoughts once; but oh! I have loſt thoſe thoughts, I have loſt thoſe perſwaſions. But when you had thoſe thoughts, and when you had thoſe perſwaſions, how came you by them? My ſoul was lying in a ſad, dark, dead, hardned condition; my ſoul was ready to ſink with deſpair: and all on a ſudden, my ſoul was raiſed up within me to this perſwaſion, for to think that Chriſt was in me, and that Chriſt liveth in me. Wel, Either theſe thoughts were from Satan, or from Chriſt, Either this perſwaſion of yours was from Satan, or it was from Chriſt: Not from Satan, for Satan doth not uſe to be ſo loving to a poor tempted ſoul, to bear it up when it is ready to ſink under Temptation; Satan doth not uſe to be ſo loving to a poor ſoul, to free it from Deſpair: Then it was from Chriſt; and if it were from Jeſus Chriſt, then Chriſt had a greater hand and ſtroke in this perſwaſion than thy own ſoul: for thou ſayeſt, I was dead, dull, hardened, ready to ſink; and I ſaid, Mercy is gone, I ſhall never ſee the face of Chriſt again; and all on a ſudden theſe perſwaſions were raiſed in me. Here Chriſt plainly hath a greater ſtroke in this perſwaſion than thine own ſoul.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:162406:69"/>
               <p>Upon all this I do now appeal unto you, who ever you are that lie under any of theſe Fears, Hath it not been thus with you? That all on a ſudden, you have been raiſed to theſe perſwaſions? Do not you find, That ſometimes your ſoul hath been carried out to God, even contrary to your own inclination and diſpoſition? Do not you find, That ſometimes your ſoul hath been carried out to what is good, beyond all that you intended? you thought to begin Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer a little while; and hath not the Lord ſometimes come in, and carried out your ſoul farther than ever you inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? Do you not find, a ſecret diſpoſition, or inclination to all the Commandements of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt? Do you not find, That in the greateſt actions, and turnings of your lives, Chriſt hath been at the end thereof? Oh! yes, If I ſhould ſpeak true, I muſt needs ſay this; Although I have not ſeen Chriſt at the end of every action, yet as for the great actions, and turnings of my life, I muſt needs ſay, Chriſt hath been there. And the Lord knows, I have a ſecret diſpoſition to the Commandements of the Goſpel. And, O Lord, thou knoweſt, that I have been carried out, many times, to what is good, contrary to mine own diſpoſition. O Lord, thou knoweſt, I have been carried further in a way of good, than ever I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. O Lord, thou knoweſt, When my ſoul hath been dead, hardened, and I have ſaid, Now mercy is gone, and I am driven from mercy; then, then hath there been perſwaſions raiſed in me, that Jeſus Chriſt is in me. Well, be of good comfort (ſoul) be of good comfort from the Lord: if thou haſt theſe perſwaſions, do not check them; and if for the preſent you have not theſe perſwaſions, yet wait on the Lord; for our Savior Chriſt hath ſaid,<note place="margin">

If theſe things be true, Then may every one ſay, Now I ſee that the In-being of Chriſt in the ſoul, is not a meer fanſie, a meer notion; but carries with it the greateſt reallity in the world. For when Chriſt is in a Beleever, there he lives, acts, and works: yea, and he hath a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtroke in the ſpiritual actions of Beleevers, than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have. Surely therefore, this In-being of Chriſt in the ſoul, is a work of power, of almighty power, the ſame power that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly. If theſe things be true, Then here may a man ſay, I ſee a great and vaſt difference, between a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and a Wicked man. Take a Wicked man, and though he be never ſo great, or rich; yet Satan is in him, Satan liveth in him, and ruleth in him; the Prince of the air ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in him; and he is taken captive by the Devil at his will. But now, take a Godly man, and though he be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo poor, and mean, yet Chriſt is in him, Chriſt liveth in him, Chriſt hath a greater hand and ſtroke in his actions than himſelf hath. Take a Wicked man, of the higheſt form, and though he do Pray, Hear, Reade, Confer, or ſpeak of good things, yet not Chriſt, but Himſelf works, and acts in him, Self worketh, and acteth him. But take a Godly man, and though he be never ſo weak, Chriſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in him, and hath a greater hand in his actions than himſelf. Who would not be Godly? who would not get into Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly. If theſe things be true, What deſparate mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is it, for any to oppoſe the Saints and Children of God? Eſpecially for the matter of their Religion, and gracious Actions? It is oppoſition done unto Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Chriſt liveth in them; and the Lord Chriſt doth ſo live in a gracious man, a Beleever, as he hath a greater ſtroke in all his Prayers, and in all his Duties than himſelf
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:162406:70"/>hath. Then for a man to ſtand and ſcorn, ſcoff, and jeer at the Prayers, Duties, and gracious actions of a Beleever; what is it, but to make oppoſition, to Chriſt Himſelf? If there be ever an Oppoſer, a Scorner in this Congregation; Poor ſoul! where wilt thou appear in the great day?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly. If all theſe things be true, Then may every Beleever ſay, Now I ſee what a great evil it is for any child of God to ſay, That his Duties are nothing but Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or the work of Chriſt Hypocriſie. Do you look upon the work of Jeſus Chriſt, as ſo vile and baſe? nothing more baſe in your eye than Hypocriſie. If Chriſt be in me, He liveth in me, He hath a greater hand and ſtroke in all my ſpiritual actions than my ſelf hath. Therefore through the grace of God, I will be for ever wary, how I ſay of my own Duties again, They are all nothing but vile Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly.

We reade of <hi>David,</hi> that when he and his people had offered a great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, he praiſeth the Lord for his own willingneſs to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer unto the Lord. So a Beleever is not only to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for what he receiveth from God, but alſo for what he himſelf doth do to God, and for God: Why? becauſe it is not be that doth it, but Chriſt living in him; and the Lord Chriſt hath a greater ſtroke in that action which he doth to God, or for God than himſelf hath. Therefore infinite reaſon, why we ſhould not only be thankful for what we receive from God, but for what we do to, and for God.</p>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:162406:71"/>to Prayer, or any Duty; yet will I go and offer my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in Prayer. Either Jeſus Chriſt will come down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Prayer, God will come down in my Duty; or elſe he will not. If the Lord do, what a mercy ſhall it be unto me! If the Lord do not come down while I am at Duty, and work all my work for me; it ſhal be my affliction, and I wil mourn after God. But whether the Lord does come down in my Duty, or whether he does not; it is as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Him, I wil wait upon the Lord, for it is He that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in us mightily. Oh! my ſoul therefore, for ever wait upon God in Duty; yea, although my heart be hard, dead, dull, and indiſpoſed thereunto.</p>

If all this be true, What gracious, holy, heavenly lives ſhould all thoſe lead, that pretend to the word <hi>Beleever.</hi> Some there are, that do pretend to the word Beleever; I am a Beleever; and they ſay they have Faith. But if I have Faith indeed, then Chriſt liveth in me; Not the World liveth in me, but Chriſt liveth in me; Not Malice liveth in me, but Chriſt liveth in me; Not Pride liveth in me, but Chriſt liveth in me. But how many are there (poor ſouls) that may ſay in truth, Pride liveth in me; and Malice liveth in me; and the World liveth in me; but Chriſt liveth not in me. And will ye ſay then, that ye have Faith? Let us not be deceived. But if this be true, That Chriſt liveth in all Beleevers, what gracious, and holy converſations ſhould the converſations of Beleevers be? And whenſoever you fail in any thing, you ſhould even ſay, Yea, but would Chriſt do ſo? My ſoul, thus and thus haſt thou ſpoken, but would Chriſt have ſpoken thus and thus?</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> If all this be true, Why ſhould we not al ſtand, wonder, and admire at the infinite love of Chriſt? It was much love in Chriſt, for to come down into our Nature; it was yet more, for to come down into our Hearts by his Spirit; yet more, for to live, act, and work there: but the Lord Chriſt he is not only come down into our Nature, come down into our Hearts, for to live, act, and work there; but the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:162406:71"/>Lord Chriſt hath an eye upon all our actions; the Lord Chriſt hath a greater ſtroke in al our Spiritual actions than our ſelves have: he is at the Beginning, and he is at the Middle, and he is at the Latter end of every action. Had the Lord Chriſt only given himſelf for us, what a great mercy had it been! but he hath given himſelf <hi>To</hi> us; not only <hi>for</hi> as, but <hi>to</hi> us; he cometh and liveth in a Beleever: he liveth more in a Beleever, than a Beleever doth himſelf. What Love, Mercy, and Grace is here! You that are Beleevers, do you know your own Priviledge? what it is to have Chriſt living in you? Only bear the word of Exhortation: you that are made partakers of this great priviledge, Chriſt living in you; <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of glory;</hi>

            <pb n="198" facs="tcp:162406:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The words tell us, of a great Miracle, wrought by our Savior Chriſt, Caſting out the Devil in one that was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed. Concerning which cure, Two things conſiderable: Where this cure was wrought: And by what means it was wrought. Wrought in the coaſts of Tyre and Sidon: And by means of a womans faith. For our Savior ſaid, <hi>O wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, great is thy faith: be it unto thee, even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole.</hi> The greatneſs of this womans faith, is ſet out by Three great Temptations that ſhe did meet withal, when ſhe came and beſought our Savior for the cure of her child.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>He anſwered her not a word;</hi> but was ſilent to all her miſery, and Prayer. This was a great Temptation, a great tryal.</p>
            <p>Secondly. He was not only ſilent; but when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſpake for her, he ſeems to give her a flat denial: <hi>I am not ſent, but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> And this was a further, and greater Temptation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. When yet ſhe preſt in upon him; he ſeems to give her the repulſe, and to call her Dog: <hi>It is not meet to take the childrens bread, and to caſt it to Dogs.</hi> Here was a great Temptation indeed. But her faith wrought through all theſe Temptations. And becauſe (as ye ſhall ſee and hear in the opening of the words) that there is none of all theſe Temptations, but one time or other, may befall the beſt of Gods children: it will be good for us to obſerve, How this womans faith wrought through every Temptation, that we may do the like in our Temptations.</p>
            <p>But before we come unto that. The holy Ghoſt here, would have us take notice, Firſt, From whence Chriſt came, and upon what occaſion. Secondly, Whither he came, and how he was received.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, it is ſaid here, <hi>[Then Jeſus went thence.]</hi> He went from the Jews. He had been (as ye reade in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the chapter) diſputing with them againſt their Traditions, <hi>Ye have made the Commandement of God void, through your Traditions,</hi> verſe 6. Whereupon they were
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:162406:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>much offended, verſe 12. Our Savior now then goes from them; they were offended, and rejected his words, and he goes from them. Theſe were the Jews that dwelt at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, not the meaneſt neither, The Scribes and Phariſees, the Learned men of that time, and thoſe that were moſt in account for Holineſs; See what entertainment the Goſpel finds in Chriſts own time among the Learned, and thoſe that were accounted the moſt Holy: Scribes, Learned men, and the Phariſees, the moſt preciſe, and ſtrict men of thoſe times, and yet here the Goſpel is rejected by them. Chriſt goes away, Chriſt goes from thence, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>

               </label> None more rigorous oppoſers of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, than Learned men, and ſuch as go for Holy, and Preciſe men, being wedded to their own inventions: So were theſe here. Know ye therefore, men wedded to their own inventions, though never ſo Learned, or never ſo ſtrict in their lives; little hope that the Goſpel, or the Lord Chriſt, ſhould find entertainment among them. Be not offended though this fall out.</p>
            <p>Jeſus went from thence: But whither went he? The text ſaies, <hi>[He departed into the coaſts of Tyre and Sidon.]</hi> How ſo? Our Lord &amp; Savior Chriſt, commanded his Diſciples, that they ſhould not go into the way of the Gentiles; but (ſaies he) <hi>Go and preach to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>but go not into the way of the Gentiles.</hi> Will Chriſt forbid his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Apoſtles to go into the way of the Gentiles, and will he himſelf go into the way of the Gentiles, go into Tyre and Sidon, how can this be? Some anſwer it thus: That the Law-giver was not bound unto the Law that he made himſelf. Others anſwer it thus: That our Lord and Savior did not go unto Tyre and Sidon for to preach, but he went thither to be hid. As in the 7. of <hi>Mark,</hi> (where ye have the ſame ſtory) <hi>From thence he aroſe and went to Tyre and Sidon, and entred into an houſe, and would have no man know it.</hi> In this reſpect now, he did not forbid his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to go into the way of the Gentiles.</p>
            <pb n="200" facs="tcp:162406:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>But the anſwer is clear, both in the 15. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and that ſame of <hi>Mark, He departed</hi>

            <p>And here now he being, A woman comes unto him. Who is deſcribed at the 22. verſe, From her Country; and from the Action which ſhe did. <hi>Behold, a woman of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan came out of the ſame coaſts, and cried unto him, ſaying, &amp;c.</hi>

And therefore our Savior ſaies afterward, <hi>It is not lawful to caſt childrens bread unto Dogs.</hi> She was a Canaanite. But now this Woman, this Canaanite, ſhe Beleeves; comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, and Beleeves greatly: <hi>O woman, great is thy faith.</hi>

               </label> Pray let us obſerve the wonderful diſpenſation of God here. The Jews that Chriſt was ſent unto, they rejected Chriſt: a Canaanite that is called a Dog, receives Chriſt. Oh! the wonderful diſpenſation of Gods grace! Mercy takes thoſe in, and Free-grace takes in thoſe into Chriſt that are moſt unlikely.

            <p>But what ſaies this woman? Saies ſhe, <hi>[Have mercy upon me, O Lord, thou Son of</hi> David, <hi>my daughter is grievouſly vexed with a Devil.</hi>] Have mercy upon me, O Lord, <hi>thou ſon of David.</hi> Why does ſhe call him the ſon of <hi>David?</hi> and not rather the ſon of <hi>Abraham?</hi> and not rather the ſon of <hi>Adam?</hi> and not rather the ſon of <hi>Man?</hi> (as Chriſt was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten called) why does ſhe here call him the ſon of <hi>David?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We find in Scripture, that Chriſt and <hi>David</hi> did often exchange Names. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>your King ſhall reign over you.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>She does firſt of all acknowledge his <hi>Deity;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe cals him Lord, <hi>O Lord:</hi> Shee does acknowledge his <hi>Humanity,</hi> and <hi>Incarnation;</hi> and therefore ſhe ſaies, <hi>Thou ſon of</hi> David. Her Faith was rightly planted: here now ye have her Faith in the Muſterd-ſeed; look but down a few verſes, and you find it grown up into a great tree, that the birds of the air, and the Saints, may come and build their neſts in the branches of her Faith. But here it is planted. She had in her own countrey, ſome that by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orſiſme did undertake for to caſt out Devils: ſhe does not go to them: ſhe had her own gods in her own countrey, ſhe leaves them, and ſhe ſingles out Chriſt, and ſhe ſingles out that Name, Title, and Attribute of Chriſt, wherein was moſt of the Covenant, and moſt of the Promiſe: and her faith now, being thus rightly planted, it riſes up unto great perfection, ſhe comes on with boldneſs.</p>
            <p>But ſtay, O woman, a little, Thou art a great ſinner, thou art a Canaanite, and ſo a Dog, and what doeſt thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

I do not plead mine own Righteouſneſs, or mine own Patience, or my Humility, or Prayer, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in prayer; but I plead Mercy, <hi>Have mercy on me, O Lord.</hi> Behold a Miracle in the midſt of a Miracle, (ſaies <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>) The Angels in heaven cover their faces, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the glory of Jeſus Chriſt; and a poor Woman here on earth comes with boldneſs: the Cherubims, and Seraphims in heaven (ſaies he) fear before Chriſt; fear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and faith below; fear in Angels, faith and boldneſs in a poor woman, ſhe comes with boldneſs.</p>

            <p>She does not only come with Boldneſs, but ſhe comes with Prayer, <hi>Have mercy upon me &amp;c.</hi> She comes Praying, for ſhe came Beleeving. Faith and Prayer well go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Prayer is the iſſue of Faith. Faith is Prayer in the Coale, and Prayer is Faith in the Flame; ſhe comes Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And mark alſo, She comes with Love; and ſuch Love, as makes another bodies infirmity and weakneſs ones own: For ſhe does not ſay thus, <hi>My Daughter is grievouſly vexed with a Devil,</hi> have mercy on my <hi>Daughter;</hi> but have mercy on <hi>Me:</hi> her daughters vexation is her own, her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity is her own. Faith wrought the Love here. Oh! that Parents would imitate this woman, and go unto Jeſus Chriſt for their Children that are vexed with Devils. If a child be ſick in body, a parent wil run to God and cry for help; but childrens ſouls may be vexed with Devils (every Luſt and Sin is a Devil) and they do not run to Chriſt and ſay, Oh! Lord, have mercy on me; for my Daughter, or my Son, or my Child, is vexed with an unclean Devil, or a prophane Devil: But this woman, having planted her
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:162406:75"/>faith rightly, her faith here it does work by Prayer, and it works by Love, and ſhe ſaies thus, <hi>Have mercy upon me, O Lord, thou ſon of</hi> David, <hi>my daughter is grievouſly vexed with a Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what now is Chriſts anſwer to her? <hi>[He anſwered her not a word.]</hi> Now comes the Temptations, the Three great Temptations; Do not wonder that I call theſe Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is true, God tempteth no man, and Chriſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no man: but take Temptation for Tryal, ſo Chriſt tempts, ſo God tempteth. Satan, he tempts a man for to draw out his Sin; but Chriſt tempts for to draw out our Faith. Satans temptations are black within, white and ſweet without: but Chriſts temptations are black without, white and ſweet within.</p>
            <p>The firſt Temptation therefore, you have here, <hi>He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her not a word.</hi> Not a word! Chriſt is called the Word: The Word anſwers not a Word. The Fountain of mercy ſeems to be incloſed; as if he rejected <hi>Her,</hi> and her <hi>Condition;</hi> as if he cared not for <hi>It,</hi> nor for <hi>Her;</hi> He anſwered her not a Word. Here was a great temptation upon the woman, a great tryal; for ſhe might ſay thus: I have heard, <hi>That the LORD heaheth Prayer;</hi> and now I come and pray unto him, he anſwers me not a Word; How is the Scripture true? I have heard that this man ſaies, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will eaſe you:</hi> and now I do come unto him, he anſwers me not a Word. The Centurion came unto him, and he hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him. A poor Leper came unto him, and he helped him; my condition is worſe than any bodies. Here was a great Temptation, Chriſt anſwered her not a word.</p>
            <p>Though Chriſt anſwered her not a word, he heard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very word: in not anſwering of her, he anſwered her. In not ſpeaking, Chriſt ſpeaketh much, (many times) for when he ſpeaks no anſwer to your prayers, the language of his actions ſpeak thus, Pray on, Cry on, and lift up your voice on High. Chriſt holds the door cloſe, not that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:162406:76"/>he may keep you out, but that he may make you knock the more. Chriſt lets you continue praying, not becauſe he does not regard your prayer, but becauſe he loves your prayer ſo well, that he would hear your prayer again and again, Chriſt knows, that ſtrength comes in wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſerv. </seg>
               </label> It is no new thing then for Beleevers to have no preſent, viſible anſwer to their prayers. But mark, although they have no viſible anſwer to their prayers, they have inviſible ſtrength: he anſwered her not a word to her prayer, but he aſſiſteth her all that while in praying: he gives her no anſwer to her prayer, but he gave her prayer, he gave her faith to continue in prayer. So long therefore, as the Lord Jeſus Chriſt does ſend down his ſpirit upon your heart in prayer; though ye have no viſible anſwer unto your prayer, yet if he uphold your heart in beleeving, ſtill to hang upon him, ſtill to wait upon him, your condition is not new, it is no other than that which befals the beſt of Gods Children and true Beleevers; thus it befell this woman.</p>
            <p>If this Temptation do befal any of you as it befel this woman, to have no viſible anſwer unto your prayer; pray do as this women did: What did ſhe?</p>
            <p>Firſt. He anſwered her not a word; but ſtill ſhe does acknowledge that he was able to help her, does acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Deity, and ſaies, <hi>Lord.</hi> So do you.</p>
            <p>Secondly. She does acknowledge; that it is his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for to help: and therefore ſhe ſaies, <hi>Thou ſon of David.</hi> So do you alſo ſay in your heart, Though I have not help for the preſent, it is the Office of Chriſt to help me; He is the ſon of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. She does not reſt upon her own Duty, or her own Righteouſneſs; but ſhe comes unto meer mercy, and ſhe waits on that. So do you alſo.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. She does propound her miſery, leave her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery at the feet of Chriſt, and does not ſtint or limit him to this or that means. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaies ſhe) <hi>my daughter is grievouſly
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:162406:76"/>vexed;</hi> but ſhe does not ſay, how ſhe would have her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cured, ſhe leaves that to Chriſt, only propounds her miſery, and leaves that at the feet of Chriſt, to take his own way, and uſe his own means. So do you alſo.</p>
            <p>Fiftly. She continues yet praying, yea, when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples had done. The Diſciples they ſaid, <hi>Send her away</hi> (at the 23. verſe) <hi>for ſhe crieth after us.</hi> Chriſt made an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to them, and ye hear no more of the Diſciples, they had done. Thus do you alſo, as this woman did, Though your Friends, and the Diſciples of Chriſt that have been praying for you, be weary, have done, and have no more to ſpeak for you; yet hold you out, and continue praying. Thus did this woman, ſhe would not leave Chriſt, but ſhe comes on afreſh, ſhe comes unto him again.</p>
            <p>What is Chriſts anſwer? <hi>[He anſwered and ſaid, I am not ſent, but unto the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.]</hi> Here now is the Second Temptation. And this indeed ſeems to be greater than the former. Before he anſwered her not a word; and now here is denyal, ſeeming denyal, <hi>I am not ſent, but unto the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> This Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is greater: for now in this his dealing, his way ſeems to run croſſe unto promiſes. The Promiſe was made unto the Gentiles; the old Teſtament is full of it: 42. of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and the 1. verſe. <hi>He ſhall bring forth judgment unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> verſe 6. <hi>I have given thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles.</hi> And ſo in many places, Mercy is promiſed unto the Gentiles. Here now our Savior ſaies, <hi>I am not ſent, but to the laſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael:</hi> His dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with this woman, ſeems to run croſſe to the Promiſes. Yea, now he comes to the great unanſwerable Objection; as if he ſhould ſay thus: There are a company of poor loſt ones, that are my ſheep, elected, predeſtinated to Salvation from all Eternity; and I am ſent unto them, I am not ſent, but unto the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this woman might ſay, Nay then, what do I waiting any longer? for is I be not one of the Elect, if I be not one of Chriſts Sheep, then there is no hope for me. This was
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:162406:77"/>a great, and a very great Temptation, to lay theſe words before her, a great Tryal, <hi>I am not ſent, but uno the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> But mark her carriage: ſhe does not fall to diſpute the matter of Election, or Predeſtination; ſhe came and worſhipped him, ſaying, <hi>Lord help me,</hi> at the 25. verſ.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly. That in caſe any poor Beleever, that is a weak perſon, weak in the faith, be tempted and tryed about Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or Predeſtination, the beſt way for the preſent is, to lay that diſpute by, and to run to mercy, and ſay, <hi>Lord help me:</hi> and for the preſent, not to diſpute whether he be a Sheep or no, Elected or no, Predeſtinated or no, but run to Chriſt, and go to Prayer, and ſay, Lord help me, and lay the diſpute by.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Again. As our Temptations encreaſe, ſo our Faith ſhal encreaſe.

According to the encreaſes of our Temptations, ſo ſhall the encreaſes of our Faith be.</p>
            <p>If al this wil not do, behold now a Third, and a greater Temptation. <hi>He anſwered and ſaid, It is not meet to take the childrens bread and to caſt it to dogs.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>It is not meet to caſt childrens bread to DOGS.]</hi> The word in the original is, a <hi>Whelp.</hi> A Dog grown, or a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiff, may be, &amp; is good for ſomething, of great uſe; but what is a Whelp good for, (for the preſent) of what uſe? It is not meet to caſt childrens bread unto Whelps.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To CAST Childrens bread]</hi> It intimates thus much, That God does caſt ſome Outward bleſſings upon Wicked men, that are even Dogs: but the bread of Children is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed, Goſpel-bread is ſo diſpenſed, as nothing ſhall be loſt.</p>
            <p>Here was a very great Temptation, and greater than the other. Dog is moſt unworthy. When the Scripture would ſet out the unworthineſs of a man, and the abject condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any, he is called a Dog. <hi>Goliah</hi> could underſtand this, <hi>Am I a Dog? that thou comeſt out thus againſt me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.43.</note> Am I ſo baſe, vile, and unworthy? am I a Dog? And ſo <hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſheth,</hi> when he would acknowledge his own Unworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>David,</hi> he cals himſelf, a Dog, and a dead Dog. So <hi>Haſael, Am I a Dog?</hi> Yet ſaies our Savior here, <hi>It is not meet to caſt childrens bread unto Dogs.</hi> This woman now, her heart might have riſen, and ſhe might have ſaid thus, (one would think) I am no Dog; I am a Woman, though a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Woman, but I am no Dog: I have now come &amp; ſpread my condition, and miſery before ye; if ye will not relieve me, do not miſcall me; if ye will not help me, yet do not abuſe me; if ye will not help me, yet pity me, do not call me Dog, I am no Dog. The Jews, that you call the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdom, they indeed are Dogs, they turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and rend you, but I do not turn again and rend you, I am no Dog. Her heart might have riſe at this phraſe: Here was a great Temptation now, a mighty Trial here in this Third thing.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Again. You may obſerve here, That the leaſt of Chriſt, is highly prized with a true Beleever: a gracious heart, a true Beleever, does highly prize and value the leaſt of Chriſt. A crumb, a crumb, Oh! if I may have but a crumb, a crumb ſhall be welcome, Lord, a crumb of mercy is wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: the loaves are for Children, but if I can get a crumb, I will praiſe God for it, I will be contented. The leaſt, the worſt of Chriſt in the eye of a Beleever, is highly valued, and he ſets a great price upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Laſtly. All this is ſaid by a Woman. Women uſually are not of that boldneſs, but more eaſily daſh'd out of countenance. Faith riſes above our Nature, and above our natural diſpoſition. Faith had gotten into this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans heart, and ſhe forgets her own diſpoſition, ſhe comes like any Man, with boldneſs upon Jeſus Chriſt, follows him, and will never let him alone. Faith riſes above our own Diſpoſitions, and above our Natures.</p>
            <p>From all this, you may obſerve here. If you be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with conſideration of your own unworthineſs, how you ſhould give an anſwer unto thoſe temptations. Do as this woman did; if I be a Dog, Lord, yet I am thy Dog; and if I be a Dog, Lord, yet crumbs belong to me; and if I be never ſo great a ſinner, mercy and grace is for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and I come to mercy. Oh! ſtill, ſtill hang upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſtill hang upon Jeſus Chriſt, and never let him go. <hi>Ab negando promittit,</hi> he does promiſe in denying.

               <hi>Why does he rather commend her Faith, than other graces? ſhe had other graces: Here is Humility in this woman to be ſeen; here is a great deal of Wiſdom in this woman to be ſeen; here is Prayer; here is Perſeverance in prayer; Chriſt commends none of theſe, but commends her Faith: why does he rather commend her Faith, than any other grace?</hi>

He commends that: It is only faith that brings Chriſt and the ſoul together; and therefore he does commend faith above all other graces.</p>
            <p>If the Lord Jeſus Chriſt does commend faith ſo, why ſhould we not all labor eſpecially to ſtrengthen our faith. Get faith, you that have it not, &amp; ſtrengthen it, you that have it. Get Humility, Patience, Wiſdom; be much in Prayer, and continue in Prayer; but above all things get Faith: Faith is the grace commended by Jeſus Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other graces; therefore we ſhould labor above all for to get faith, and to ſtrengthen faith. It is obſerved from this place, that Chriſt commends none but the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, the faith of the Gentiles: He ſaies concerning the Centurion, <hi>I have not found ſo great faith, no not in Iſrael:</hi> he was a Gentile. And here he ſaies concerning this women, <hi>O woman, great is thy faith:</hi> and ſhe was a Gentile. What ever therefore thou haſt been; though a Canaanite, though a Sinner, though a great Sinner; get faith, labor to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:162406:79"/>then thy faith, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will own thy faith at the laſt: though for the preſent he ſeems to hide himſelf from thee, yet he will own it at the laſt, and he will commend it at the laſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly. He commends here the Greatneſs of her faith. Wherein was the Greatnes of her faith? Faith conſiſts in the knowledge of Chriſt, aſſent unto the truth, a relying upon God in Chriſt in time of temptation, it's a Coming to Jeſus Chriſt; an Adherence to him. But the greatneſs of her faith lay in this, That in the midſt of all theſe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, yet ſhe did hang on Chriſt, and would not be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten off by any of theſe diſcouragements, or temptations. Here was the greatneſs of her faith.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſerv. </seg>
               </label> The ſtrength of faith does not lie in the aſſurance of our Salvation, or of Gods love, or of the mercy that we deſire in prayer; one may have ſtrong faith, and yet no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: I ſay, not only faith but ſtrong faith. This wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had no Aſſurance (that we reade of) not aſſurance of the thing that ſhe begged, that the Lord would hear her prayer; ſhe had no aſſurance of it, only ſhe hung upon Chriſt, and would not away. And when he put her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſhe gathered in upon him: in the midſt of all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and oppoſition, ſtill ſhe did hang upon him. So then, a man may have faith, and ſtrong faith, although he have no aſſurance.</p>
            <p>And upon this account, How many are there that have ſtrong faith, that think they have no faith at all. Some think they have no faith, becauſe they cannot ſay, Chriſt is mine, Mercy is mine, Heaven is mine: but yet, if in the time of your temptation ye can hand upon Chriſt, and will not away from Chriſt, but will ſtill hang upon him, ſtill wait upon him; you have not only faith, but you may have ſtrong faith, a great faith as this woman had. And let me tell you this for your comfort: at the laſt the Lord will make a report of your faith unto your own heart: Yea, he will make a report anſwerable to your temptation: for you may obſerve here, That as the wound
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:162406:80"/>was made, ſo the plaiſter was laid. You have Three great temptations: Anſwerably now, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt does teſtifie of this womon. Firſt of all, <hi>He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her not a word,</hi> would not own her, would not ſpeak to her: Now (ſaies he) <hi>O woman.</hi> Then he ſaid, <hi>That he was not ſent, but unto the loſt ſheep.</hi> Now he does own her for a Sheep, and he ſaies ſhe hath <hi>Faith.</hi> Before he ſaies, <hi>It is not meet to caſt childrens bread to dogs.</hi> This did argue that ſhe was a Dog, one moſt Unworthy. Now he ſaies, that ſhe is moſt Worthy; O woman, thou haſt not only faith, but thou haſt a great faith, <hi>O woman, great is thy faith.</hi> So that I ſay, ſtill hang upon Chriſt; in all your Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the midſt of all your Diſcouragments, ſtill hang upon Chriſt; and the Lord Jeſus, he will not only make a report of your faith unto ye, but according as your temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations riſe, ſo ſhall the report of your grace be from the Lord Chriſt unto your poor ſoul: therefore hang upon Chriſt.</p>
            <p>He does not only here, give a teſtimony of her faith, and the greatneſs of her faith; but now he does give the Thing: <hi>Be it unto thee as thou wilt.</hi> Chriſt can deny nothing to a true Beleever: a Beleever may have what he will of Chriſt at laſt. Chriſt cannot hold: though he do hide himſelf from his brethren (as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did) for a time, he cannot hold it out alwaies, he cannot hold out the ſiege alwaies, but he will give up himſelf to a poor Beleever, O poor Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, Be it according as thou wilt: thou wouldſt have Grace, thou wouldſt have this or that Mercy; Be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</p>
            <p>I'le only take one Leſſon from all, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p>And the great Leſſon that we ſhould all Learn from this whole Story is, <hi>To beleeve in the face of all Diſcouragement, of all Oppoſition, all Temptation; ſtill to hang upon Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The very reading of this ſtory provokes us hereunto.
